Finishing Each product is different and as a result, each product has its own unique finishing requirements. We strive to ensure that every product is finished to the high standards expected of world class die-casters, including: secondary production, vibratory finishing and coating. About Us The journey of Diecasting Solutions started in the back of a North Shore factory in early 2004, when an absence of players in the Australasian die-casting industry inspired David Dale (Director) to set out and convert a plastic molding machine into a Zinc die-casting machine. Today, their unique die-casting machines prove for faster delivery, allowing them to run up to five dies in each machine at a time and change dies in less than ten minutes, whilst maintaining high quality cast parts. Incorporating both his design and tool-making background, David brought these services in-house, bridging the gap between client, designer and toolmaker. This highly effective scenario reduces costs associated with outsourcing tool-making and cuts production time. This one stop shop has worked well for Diecasting Solutions, designing and manufacturing hundreds of products for clients in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

34,4," Application of Casting in Automobile Industry As technology is ever-evolving, finding quicker, faster, and more cost-efficient ways to manufacture parts is an absolute necessity. Here, we will discuss the applications of casting in the automobile industry and cover the benefits of using zinc die casting. Benefits of Casting Automobile Parts The most common application for zinc die casting occurs in the auto industry. In fact, the idea behind die casting was originally created for automobiles. Since vehicles require complex shapes and sizes for different parts of the vehicle, it is almost mandatory to use zinc die casting. Due to the precise accuracy of this process, the need for further machining is practically non-existent. This alone saves an exuberant amount of time and money for the manufacturing of automobile parts. One can typically use zinc for retractor gears, seat belt pulleys, and camshafts, as well as a multitude of other parts on most vehicles. This amazing metal provides strength, flexibility, and malleability that you cannot match with other materials. Zinc has a lowering melting point, allowing for less energy during production. Different Casting Components for Automobiles As previously mentioned, vehicle manufacturing is the most common use for the application of casting in the automobile industry. Zinc die casting is able to produce an aesthetic appearance while providing the capabilities of creating unique shapes with a high durability tolerance. Zinc alloy carries high anti-corrosive properties, making it the ideal element for the automobile industry. Here is a list of some of the parts that you can manufacture using this process: Parts for Sunroofs Chassis Parts Transmission Components Vehicle Interior Components Air-Conditioning Systems Engine Parts Brake Systems and Hardware Power Steering Systems Fuel Intake Parts Other Mechanical Parts And More… Contact The Professionals Get your business running at full capacity by contacting the number 1 casting company.

58,1,"Hebert Foundry & Machine, Inc. has extensive experience in the aluminum sand casting foundry industry. The process of pouring molten aluminum into a sand mold continues to be a cost effective process, supplying parts to a variety of industries. Because of its positive features, aluminum remains the metal of choice across the automotive industry. Notwithstanding the automotive industry, aluminum sand casting continues to be used in other areas of the transportation industry including in aircraft and marine applications.Other industries served include machine tool fabrication, communication, medical and laboratory testing equipment, and food preparation machinery. Aluminum sand casting is the right choice for products that require hollow cavities and complex, unique arrangements of voids, shapes and ribs. Aluminum sand castings can be supplied in sizes from fractions of an ounce to 400 pounds; from 3/8 inch to 120 inches in width or length; and from one piece to tens of thousands of units.Aluminum castings are typically 0.10 pounds per cubic inch vs. 0.25 for ZA-12, 0.28 for iron, 0.29 for steel, 0.30/0.31 for brass/bronze, 0.33 for stainless steel. For high quantity applications, HFM can supply and machine permanent mold aluminum sand castings for the lowest price and highest dimensional quality with short turnaround times.HFM provides aluminum sand casting in the following alloys:• 355 and 356 aluminum alloys which are heat treated to T6 and T7 conditions• 319 aluminum alloy which is typically used without heat treatment (F)• 443 aluminum alloy• 535 aluminum-magnesium alloy for elongation and corrosion resistance• 713 aluminum alloy for physical strength of 356 without the heat treatment• ZA-12 zinc-aluminum for replacement of grey iron castings in many applications  ",1798
58,2,"Hebert Foundry and Machine, Inc. is a family owned and operated business with nearly 100 years of experience in the green sand casting and machining industries. Our staff of engineers, patternmakers, and metallurgists will ensure that your company chooses the right material and pattern to address your green sand casting needs. Green Sand Casting continues as the most widely used and cost effective process for sand casting. The process begins with the creation of a pattern that duplicates the shape of the desired part. Depending on the application of the part and desired outcome, HFM offers two sand compositions for the no bake sand casting process. One no bake sand casting process utilizes a molding material that is low cost and reusable. Typically, green sand is composed of washed, graded, dried, and screened/sized silica sand that is bonded with various natural clays and water. Other ingredients are used to achieve specific properties to allow molten metal to be formed in “near net shape”. The alternative composition utilizes sand molds of chemically bonded sand that are only used once. This process is superior for heavier castings and generally exhibits better dimensional control than traditional green sand. The “no-bake” molds can be assembled to form intricate castings. Cores, created from various compositions within the mold cavity, form the internal (and sometimes intricate) structure of hollow castings. The green sand casting process, and the no-bake sand casting process, facilitates the casting of complex parts. Castings produced from green sand handle vibration and stress much better than assemblies secured by fasteners. HFM green sand castings reduce weight and furnish rounded edges that are safer and more aesthetically pleasing than sharp, machined edges. The green sand casting process reduces the need for assemblies which significantly minimizes the need for machining and ultimately improves the tolerance of the finished product.  ",1978

63,1,"The Lost Wax Casting Process Art Castings of Colorado uses the lost wax casting process to cast both bronze and stainless steel sculptures. The lost wax process has been used since ancient times and produces exacting, finely detailed reproductions of the original work. Many other foundries use the lost wax casting process but most of Art Castings clients will tell you that there are many things that clearly sets them apart from the competition. The basic steps are the same whether you are creating stainless steel or bronze artwork – make a mold, pour the wax, “chase” the wax, create a ceramic shell, dewax and pour the metal, sandblast the cast metal, weld all the pieces together, chase the metal, apply patina and mount it to a base.

Our titanium casting foundry is AS9100 and ISO 9001 certified, and utilizes state-of-the-art equipment to ensure consistent quality and lead times. INDUSTRIES SERVED INDUSTRIAL Ti Squared Castings manufactures an extensive portfolio of industrial applications with titanium and super alloys that offer the high strength and corrosion resistant material characteristics necessary for the most challenging environments worldwide. INDUSTRIES SERVED DEFENSE Ti Squared Castings is a registered ITAR and FFL Manufacturer offering best-in-class titanium defense components that boast impressive strength, weight and corrosion resistance in extreme work environments and severe duty applications. INDUSTRIES SERVED MEDICAL Ti Squared Castings is an emerging industry leader in providing high quality titanium castings for global medical suppliers. Titanium’s ability to withstand the harsh bodily environment makes it a prime candidate for use in the medical industry. TITANIUM CASTING Process Overview Our team of experts can utilize current product prints or work in tandem with our trusted partners to create a product print for full production casting or rapid prototype. Upon receipt of the print, our team creates a master pattern mold out of steel. Wax is then injected into the steel mold to create a wax pattern. Alternatively, our team can create a wax pattern through cutting edge 3D printing technologies. Our team works in tandem with our customers in order to select the most cost effective approach for their castings. The wax patterns created are then assembled into a wax tree to be cast in a one batch pour. Once the wax tree has been assembled, we apply the investment materials. Ti Squared Castings utilizes the world’s most advanced robotic investing line equipment in order to consistently apply investing materials for high quality castings. The wax mold, with the newly applied hardened ceramic shell, is then inserted into the autoclave, where the wax is melted out of the ceramic shell. Once the wax has been removed, our team puts the empty ceramic mold into our burnout kiln in order to rapidly heat the mold. This rapid heat removes any moisture or residual wax within the mold, resulting in a solid mass mold for casting. The ceramic mold is then inserted into one of our multiple vacuum furnaces. Our titanium casting foundry utilizes the best German manufactured vacuum furnaces the world has to offer in order to ensure the highest product quality. Titanium is then poured into the mold in order to create the titanium casting. Once the mold has cooled, the ceramic shell is removed from the titanium casting. The titanium casting is then subject to machining, Hot Isostatic Pressing, welding, sanding, or polishing per the specifications of the specific part. The post casting processes provide our customers with a fully finished and functional product for use in their designated commercial and consumer applications.

81,6,"The strengths of TITANIUM What is TI Titanium is a chemical element most notably championed for its high strength-to weight ratio, corrosion resistance and its ability to retain its structural form under a multitude of extreme mechanical stresses. Titanium exhibits the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metallic element. Pure grade titanium has the ultimate tensile strength equal to most common grades of steel alloys, while remaining 45% less dense. Once titanium is exposed to oxygen, it acquires a stable oxide film which provides the material with a firm layer of protection. This oxide film results in an outstanding resistance to corrosion in a wide range of aggressive environments. Unlike other metals, titanium is able to maintain its original form under long-term exposure to mechanical stresses including high temperatures and pressures.

82,1,"sales@sdcofin.com About Us SDC was originally founded in the early 60's by Barclay F. Smith as Scotch Diecasting Company. The company operated in Berkley, MO, a suburb of St. Louis. In 1976 the company was sold and later re-incorporated as SDC Inc.  B.F. Smith later went on to found other companies in the St Louis area before fully retiring. In 1980 SDC constructed a 15,000 sq. ft. manufacturing plant situated on a 3 acre lot in Sullivan, MO. Zinc die casting was its main focus, but aluminum die casting was soon added to facilitate new customers. Throughout the 80's and 90's secondary services continued to be added to add value the castings being produced. In 2016 SDC constructed an additional 8,500 sq. ft. onto existing building for increased manufacturing space and improved shipping / warehouse space. Like many companies in the past several years, SDC has redefined its core business of 30 years and became a leaner and more agile supplier. We have expanded services and responsibilities to a broader range of products and materials. As of April 1, 2022 SDC Inc. was acquired by SDC of Indiana LLC.

82,2,"sales@sdcofin.com Aluminum Die Casting Aluminum Die Cast equipment ranges from 300 Tons to 700 Tons clamping capacity. The machinery has PLC controllers to stabilize the process. The aluminum machines utilize an advanced pressure pour dosing furnace. The furnaces are controlled by the PLC to dispense the molten metal to the machine automatically. This dosing process has proven to be the most efficient method to deliver pure aluminum alloy to the die cast machine. Aluminum Die Cast Alloys 380, 383, 360 & 413 are standard alloys run. The size produced ranges varies from an ounce or less to a 6 pound casting weight. As the parts are cast with the machines running an automatic cycle they are operator monitored and defects are removed as they are produced, as the castings are cooled they are then trimmed from the runner system and further processed thru secondary operations as needed. Parts are burnished, machined, plated, or powder coated as required by the customer. From a simple knob or handle to a complex valve body or fishing reel frame, aluminum Die castings offer great dimensional stability, repeatability, corrosion resistance (A360, A413), and strength. From toys to trains, to planes, to lawnmowers, to power tools the usage of aluminum continues to play a part in most every industry. ALUMINUM ALLOYS Aluminum die casting alloys are lightweight, offer good corrosion resistance, ease of casting, good mechanical properties and dimensional stability. 360 -Selected for good corrosion resistance. Special alloys for special applications are available, but their use usually entails significant cost premiums. 380 -An alloy which provides the best combination of utility and cost. 383 & 384 -These alloys are a modification of 380. Both provide better die filling, but with a moderate sacrifice in mechanical properties, such as toughness. 390 -Selected for special applications where high strength, fluidity and wear-resistance/bearing properties are required. 413 -Used for maximum pressure tightness, fluidity, and corrosion resistance.

A universal pallet fixture allows quick change from job to job. Programming is stored at the machine with reference to the project pallet for the job, this makes change over a very routine function and helps eliminate program variables. Okuma turning center, a very robust dependable center with 8 tool changer. A great CNC for everyday turning of bearing areas, o-ring grooves, and special shapes. Drilling and Tapping After years of building special machines for drilling and tapping our arsenal of drilling, tapping heads, and power feed units are very flexible. High volume parts that require basic drilling & tapping operations are generally tooled for dedicated operations. This allows 2-10 operations to be done in one cycle and gives higher yield than done on CNC machines. Multiple conventional Drilling & Tapping units provide great support for all general machining operations.

82,6,"sales@sdcofin.com Zinc Die Casting Zinc Die Castings, while being over twice as heavy as aluminum, have many uses in the everyday products we use today. Zinc alloys offer tight tolerances and extremely repeatable production processes. SDC uses Frech fully automatic zinc machines producing parts ranging from a few grams to 2.5 pounds. Zinc parts can be produced to extremely fine detail with very little draft required on sidewalls and cored holes. Zinc Die castings tooling is long lasting and easy to maintain compared to Aluminum tolling. The melting temperature is lower in zinc die casting as well as the pressure required to produced the casting is much less than aluminum. If your part is a part requiring close tolerances or thin complex shapes zinc die casting may well be the answer to saving special machining operations. Our team will be happy to assist you in your evaluation. Zinc Alloys Zinc-based alloys are the easiest to die cast. Ductility is high and impact strength is excellent, making these alloys suitable for a wide range of products. Zinc alloys can be cast with thin walls and excellent surface smoothness making preparation for plating and painting relatively easy. It is essential that only high purity (99.99 + 0/0) zinc metal be used in the formulation of alloys. Low limits on lead, tin and cadmium ensure the long-term integrity of the alloys strength and dimensional stability. Zinc-aluminum (Za) Alloys ZA alloys represent a family of zinc-based die casting materials which contain higher aluminum content than standard zinc alloys. These alloys provide high strength characteristics plus high hardness and good bearing properties. Thin wall castability characteristics and die life are similar to zinc alloys. ZA-8 is recommended for hot chamber die casting, whereas ZA-12 and ZA-27 must be cast by the cold chamber die casting process. All ZA alloys offer similar creep properties and are superior to standard zinc alloys. Four-Slide Die Casting Four-Slide Zinc Die casting is a special method of Die Casting requiring a special type of Die Casting machinery. SDC uses Dynacast Model 2A machines. While being limited on size (Max part weight 40g), the machines are extremely efficient & highly accurate. Parts are cast to net shape at speeds up to 40 shots/min. Most tooling for the 4 slide machine will be more economical than for conventional die cast tooling. If you require small complex parts in high volumes over 25,000 per order, the multi-slide approach may be you best solution. Typical applications are connectors, small housings, office parts, small valves, munitions components, air fittings, special components, fractional motor brackets, Nano technology packaging.

113,5,"Quality Aluminum and Zinc Die Casting Quality Aluminum and Zinc Die Casting Information WHAT IS DIE CASTING? Die casting process The basic die casting process consists of injecting molten metal under high pressure into a steel mold called a die. Die casting machines are typically rated in clamping tons equal to the amount of pressure they can exert on the die. Machine sizes range from 200 tons to 5,000 tons. Regardless of their size, the only fundamental difference in die casting machines is the method used to inject molten metal into a die. The two methods are hot chamber or cold chamber. A complete die casting cycle can vary from less than one second for small components weighing less than an ounce, to two-to-three minutes for a casting of several pounds, making die casting the fastest technique available for producing precise non-ferrous metal parts. Die construction Dies, or die casting tooling, are made of alloy tool steels in at least two sections, the fixed die half, or cover half, and the ejector die half, to permit removal of castings.  There are four types of dies: Single cavity to produce one componentMultiple cavity to produce a number of identical partsCombination die to produce several different parts for an assemblyUnit die to produce different parts at one timeFrom a design point of view, it is best to design parts with uniform wall thicknesses and cores of simple shapes. Heavy sections cause cooling problems, trapped gases causing porosity. All corners should be radiused generously to avoid stress concentration. Draft allowance should be provided to all for releasing the parts – these are typically 0.25º to 0.75º per side depending on the material. Die Casting Advantages Die casting is an efficient, economical process offering a broader range of shapes and components than any other manufacturing technique. Parts have a longer service life when compared to plastic, and may be designed to complement the visual appeal of the surrounding part. Designers can gain a number of advantages and benefits by specifying die cast parts. High-speed production – Die casting provides complex shapes within closer tolerances than many other mass production processes. Little or no machining is required, and thousands of identical castings can be produced before additional tooling is required.Dimensional accuracy and stability – Die casting produces parts that are durable and dimensionally stable, while maintaining close tolerances.Strength and weight – Die cast parts are stronger than plastic injection moldings having the same dimensions. Thin-wall castings are stronger and lighter than those possible with other casting methods. Plus, because die castings do not consist of separate parts welded or fastened together, the strength is that of the alloy rather than the joining process.Multiple finishing techniques – Die cast parts can be produced with smooth or textured surfaces, and they are easily plated or finished with a minimum of surface preparation.Simplified Assembly – Die castings provide integral fastening elements, such as bosses and studs. Holes can be cored and made to tap drill sizes, or external threads can be cast. From a design point of view, it is best to design parts with uniform wall thicknesses and cores of simple shapes. Heavy sections cause cooling problems, trapped gases causing porosity. All corners should be radiused generously to avoid stress concentration. Draft allowance should be provided to all for releasing the parts-these are typically 0.25º to 0.75º per side depending on the material.

113,6,"Quality Aluminum and Zinc Die Casting Quality Aluminum and Zinc Die Casting Die Casting Alloys ALLOYS  Die casting alloys are normally non-ferrous, and there is a large number available with a wide range of physical and mechanical properties covering almost every conceivable application a designer might require. Aluminum and zinc alloys are the most widely used, and are followed by magnesium, zinc-aluminum (AZ) alloys, copper, tin and lead. Zinc, lead, and tin based alloys are classified as low melting point metals, all melting at less than 725oF (385oC). Zinc-aluminum (ZA) alloys have a slightly higher melting range of 800oF to 900oF (426oC to 482oC). Aluminum and magnesium alloys are considered to be moderate melting point alloys, being cast in the 1150oF to 1300oF (621oC to 704oC) range. Copper alloys are considered to be high melting pint, over 1650oF (899oC). Low melting point alloys are cast in hot chamber machines. Intermediate and high melting point alloys are cast in cold chamber machines. In recent years, specially designed hot chamber machines for die casting magnesium alloys have come into use Aluminum alloys Aluminum die casting alloys are lightweight, offer good corrosion resistance, ease of casting, good mechanical properties and dimensional stability. Although a variety of aluminum alloys made from primary or recycled metal can be die cast, most designers select standard alloys listed below: 360 — Selected for best corrosion resistance. Special alloys for special applications are available, but their use usually entails significant cost premiums. 380 — An alloy which provides the best combination of utility and cost. 383 & 384 — These alloys are a modification of 380. Both provide better die filling, but with a moderate sacrifice in mechanical properties, such as toughness. 390 — Selected for special applications where high strength, fluidity and wear-resistance/bearing properties are required. 413 (A13) — Used for maximum pressure tightness and fluidity. Zinc alloys Zinc base alloys are the easiest to die cast. Ductility is high and impact strength is excellent, making these alloys suitable for a wide range of products. Zinc alloys can be cast with thin walls and excellent surface smoothness making preparation for plating and painting relatively easy. It is essential that only high purity (99.99 + 0/0) zinc metal be used in the formulation of alloys. Low limits on lead, tin and cadmium ensure the long-term integrity of the alloy’s strength and dimensional stability. Zinc-Aluminum ZA alloys ZA alloys represent a new family of zinc based die casting materials which contain higher aluminum content than standard zinc alloys. These alloys provide high strength characteristics plus high hardness and good bearing properties (Table 2). Thin wall castability characteristics and die life are similar to zinc alloys. ZA-8 is recommended for hot chamber die casting, which ZA-12 and ZA-27 must be cast by the cold chamber die casting process. All ZA alloys offer similar creep properties and are superior to standard zinc alloys. ZA-8 — Provides strength, hardness and creep properties. ZA-12 — Provides excellent bearing properties with strength and hardness characteristics between ZA-8 and ZA-27, plus good dimensional stability properties and somewhat better castability than ZA-27. ZA-27 — Offers the highest mechanical properties of the ZA family and is, therefore, recommended when maximum performance is required. Magnesium alloys Magnesium alloys are noted for low weight, high strength to weight ratio, exceptional damping capacity, and ease of machining. Casting temperatures are about the same as aluminum, and both hot chamber and cold chamber machines are used to produce castings. Casting rates for magnesium are high because of its low heat content which produces rapid solidification. For the same reason, less energy is required to heat the metal to casting temperature. AZ91HP (high purity) alloy has been developed for die casting parts subject to corrosive environments. Because of lower levels of nickel, iron, copper and silicon versus AZ91B, this alloy is finding applications in automobiles, computers and peripheral equipment, and in other applications where paint or coatings are either undesirable or expensive. Although magnesium die castings are used uncoated, they can be finished in a variety of ways to give increased protection against corrosion, wear and abrasion resistance, and to improve appearance. Common inorganic treatments include chemical dips, anodizing and plating. Organic coatings — oil, wax, resin or paint — are usually applied over chemical treatments or anodizing to seal the surface, increase corrosion protection and provide an attractive appearance.

121,1,"Victoria Precision Products, Inc. On-Site Waste Water Treatment Experts Home Septic Systems Precast Products Services Resources About Gallery Contact More Aerobic Systems Aerobic systems are the latest in onsite sewage disposal.  These systems are essentially a compact sewage treatment plant.  Waste is aerobically treated and processed, treated with liquid chlorine in the form of standard household bleach and typically dispersed on top of the ground by means of sprinklers.  The aerobic system provides a homeowner or other facility with an alternative where conventional or other type septic systems won't function.  An aerobic system is extremely efficient and is rapidly becoming the system of choice for onsite sewage disposal. HOW THE AQUA AIRE®SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM FUNCTIONS The Aqua Aire® sewage treatment plant in many ways is a scaled down version of larger township and municipality sewage treatment plants. It employs an extended aeration activated sludge process. This type of treatment depends primarily upon the use of air that is introduced by passing through the diffuser bar.Ecological Tanks Inc., Aqua Aire®. Wastewater from your home enters the first compartment of the tank where the solids are settled out.  Then it flows directly into the mixing tank where simple hydraulic displacement is accomplished by the introduction of air which promotes the growth of aerobic organisms in much larger amounts than would occur naturally. These break down the organic solids in the wastewater.The Aqua Aire® model AA500-4075 is a four compartment rectangular configurations partitioned by internal dividing walls in the treatment plant. It is comprised of a forward pre-treatment tank, an aeration mixing zone, a settling or clarifier compartment and a rear pump tank compartment. Wastewater first enters the pre-treatment tank compartment of the plant, then gravity flows through a 4"" SDR 35 PVC inlet to the aeration mixing zone. The mixed liquid then enters the settling or clarifier compartment and continues to flow upward to the discharge pipe. From the plant’s discharge pipe, the final effluent then passes through a disinfection or chlorination device into the pump tank compartment for storage and contact mixing. The treated and disinfected effluent is then safely discharged, via an application pump, to a surface spray, subsurface drip, low pressure dose or absorptive mound disposal area. The result of the Aqua Aire process is a clear, odorless effluent discharge, which meets and exceeds state and national water quality standards.

121,2,"Victoria Precision Products, Inc. On-Site Waste Water Treatment Experts Home Septic Systems Precast Products Services Resources About Gallery Contact More Low Pressure Systems The Low Pressure Dosing (LPD) System works well in soils in which conventional, gravity-flow systems have failed. Such soils are typically tight clay soils in which there is no evidence of a seasonal high-water table (as evidenced by mottling or discoloration of the soil).The sewage is treated in the same manner as in a conventional dual-compartment septic tank. Once the partially treated sewage leaves the second compartment of the tank, it gravity flows into the pump chamber from which it is pumped into a drainfield consisting of small-diameter, perforated pipes. These perforated pipes are placed in a narrow trench on a bed of gravel at a depth of from 18-36 inches and covered with a geotextile fabric. The trench is backfilled with Class II soil. The effluent is forced into the surrounding soil where the wastewater treatment process is completed. Proper design and installation is important in order to avoid the possibility of the contamination of ground water.LPD system drainfields are sized according to gallons per day of anticipated water usage; therefore, use beyond these limits results in ponding of effluent on the surface of the drainfield. The careful monitoring of water conservation measures is extremely important to the proper functioning of LPD drainfields. Get a free estimate! © 2017 by Victoria Precision Products.

Our experienced team can help with casting design and pattern set up, including running systems to ensure a quality, defect free casting is produced. Industries we support include: The largest project JAMES COPPELL LEE was proud to be involved in was the “Fountain of Wealth“ located in Suntec City Singapore.It is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the World’s Largest Fountain.  A 12 month undertaking during 1994/5, the fountain is fabricated from hundreds of Silicon Bronze cast Panels. The curved shape panels typically were approximately 1200 square x 6 mm thick, the majority cast at our foundry in La Trobe Street, Melbourne. Our team was confronted with many challenges, including capacity, the required lead times and logistics. Moulds were large and could weigh up to 1500 kgs each. The castings needed to be of very high quality with precision finishing. The fountain is 14 metres tall, 66 metres in circumference, weighing apx. 85,000 kgs. A symbol of wealth and life, the fountain’s design is based on the Hindu Mandala, meaning universe, and is a symbolic representation of oneness in spirit and unity. The bronze ring further symbolises the equality and harmony of all races and religions in Singapore. We are very proud of what was accomplished, the finished structure is a testament to the dedication and skill of all of the James Coppell Lee team.  Get In Touch ",2274

Extensive and complicated machining is undertaken by our customers. Most patterns are made from aluminum, called matchplates and have a long life before wearing out. Wooden patterns can be used provided the quantities are low and the wall thickness fairly substantial. Pattern Makers also manufacture the core boxes required (see under Core Making). Shell core boxes can be made in cast iron, steel or aluminum. CO2 core boxes are made in aluminum or wood. Patterns are not made in house, but are generally contracted out. Impregnation Coastal Foundry uses a Henkel Loctite® wet vacuum impregnation system to to seal all types of metal castings and non-metal composite parts. Impregnation: Coastal Foundry’s system uses Chemence resin and is specialized formicroporosityonly Castings: Metal castings, ferrous and non-ferrous, iron, steel, brass, bronze, aluminum and any exotic alloy can be sealed with our impregnation system. Non-Metal & Composite Parts: The Loctite® impregnation process can seal all types of plastics and composite parts for many different industries. Coating and Painting Powder Coating or Painting: Powder coating, painting and anodizing is contracted out to very reputable companies that follow our own high quality control procedures. Anodizing: Anodizing is contracted out as well to companies that utilise high quality materials. Recycling Practices at Coastal Foundry Coastal Foundry Company captures and recycles resources whenever possible. Here are some examples of the materials and resources we reuse: Sand: Green and No-Bake sand are the main components used in manufacturing the molds and has the advantage of being continually recycled.

134,3,"506 Rosamond, Houston TX, 713-695-4008 Specializing only inAluminum, Brass & Bronze Alloys About Coastal Foundry Coastal Foundry Company was founded as an aluminum foundry in 1947 in a garage in the back yard of the present premises and began by manufacturing lighting fixtures. We’ve come a long way since then! Harold Gluckman purchased the foundry in 1978 and over the next 40 years added numerous new machines and equipment to keep up with the increase in production caused by the oil boom at that time. An automatic green sand regeneration system was one of the many items installed. In 1980, an additional 15,000 square feet of building was added and in 1988, the original old garage and wooden building was replaced with a new 10,000 square foot steel building.. Brass and bronze were added to the range of metals poured and today Coastral Foundry manufactures castings in a number of different aluminum and copper based alloys. The foundry premises today consists of 2 acres of land with approximately 30,000 square feet of production facilities. The production equipment used is considerable, involving numerous molding machines, shell core machines, automatic sand recirculation systems, compressors, gas fired furnaces, an induction furnace, cut-off machines, grinding machines, a wheelabrating machine, vibratory deburring machine, a sand recycling plant and many other items of machinery used in the casting process. Let Coastal Foundry Company manufacture products for you! Industries Served Marine This thru hole bronze transducer posed several challenges. It required 0.125” to 0.1875” thin walls and a solid stem requiring M22x1.5 machine threading, with no porosity, which can be hugely challenging to produce. We poured with approved 92200 navy bronze. With our pattern set up and gating as to not interfere with the cosmetics of the casting in finishing, we utilized other proprietary molding methods and adjusted the temperature of the alloy for optimal flow to cast a very high-quality part with no issues. Oil and Gas The aluminum impeller required us to come up with a way to pour with A356.2 T6 without the possibility of porosity throughout and hold the strength all the way thru to the impellers vanes; considering that the finished impeller sits inside a housing for a degasser and spins at a high rate of speed requiring fine balanced machining and all vanes worked to high tolerances, solidity and no porosity was a must. Since the vanes extrude out from a solid circle we decided to direct pour the alloy into the mold from a center pad instead of gating with contacts at certain areas of the pattern and adjust the temperature of the alloy poured to optimize the flow all the way from the center to the outer vanes. The outcome was a very high-quality casting that machined great and approved for production. Customer Testimonials  The piston you made for us cleaned up & looked nice once finished. I wanted to express my appreciation for taking care of us in such a rush.

254,15," Skirt Liners Keech skirt liners are an adjustable wear liner used across a range of GET and industrial applications. Available in Keech high impact steels and white irons. Features a weld on adapter. Tapered to suit conveyors and apron feeders. Skirt Liners Keech Skirtliners are an adjustable, lightweight and easy to install wear liner used across a range of mining and industrial applications. Design features: Benefits: Uses: Why use Skirtliners? Skirtliners are used in a feed hopper along the bottom edge of the sidewall to stop dirt and rock that has dropped onto a belt or an apron feeder pan from spilling over the edge. Skirtliners form the shape of the belt load as the belt carries the material away, to ensure it is not overloaded and doesn’t spill over. Depending on the speed of the belt and the abrasiveness of the material it can be a high wearing area. It is desirable to have the bottom of the skirt liner running as close as possible to the passing belt because should a rock  lodge between the belt and the liner it can rip the belt  causing major disruption while it is repaired and costing a large amount to fix. For this reason it is important to be able to adjust the liner height. How do Skirtliners work? Keech Skirtliners can be changed out by one person and result in reduced shut down times. Maximum wear protection extends the life of valuable mining and industrial equipment.  Related Products Contact Us Follow Us Newsletter Email address:First Name:Last Name:  ",1496

TheMATRIXshows aluminum being castable by a variety of different processes with die cast, sand cast, permanent mold and investment cast being typical first stops. We'll walk you through how to decide again by understanding your end product need. ​ Typical needs of aluminum castings include: near net shape, high strength to weight ratio, fine surface finish, wear resistance, cost effective to other options. Each process noted on the MATRIX page has a high degree of dimensional stability with aluminum, as well as castable density run over run.  Solidification modeling is used extensively in tooling development no matter what process is chosen. This leads to ‘first shot’ success and limited resampling, once defined porosity is well controlled in any of the noted processes. ​ Tool life in Aluminum is excellent but does vary by process. Machinability inaluminum is another high point,with a low machine tool wear.  Production casting tooling can be had for as little as $4K and available for production in as little as 3 weeks.Aluminum castings can be painted,plated,polished, anodized.  Typical markets are Power tool, power distribution,r ecreational, military, aerospace, automotiveandthe list goes on. ​ Phone: 262-377-4553PO Box 11Cedarburg, WI 53012 © 2019 Casting Solutions ",1571
255,2,"CSI Home CSI Matrix Metals Processes CSI Galleries CSI Team Contact Our Contact IRON Iron can be produced through powdered metal/MIM as well as through sand and investment casting. Sand casting is where most of the tonnage runs. Iron is heavily alloyed with the ability to cost effectively meet a slew of different product demands. Standard irons are gray and ductile grades which are used in automotive, heavy equipment, pumps etc….When looking at small net shape components considering powdered metal can be highly cost effective, while also gaining excellent surface finish and best near net shape. ​ High wear and abrasion resistance is another class leading area of iron often called the white irons. General toughness as well fatigue strength are other defining characteristics of iron castings. Chisel points, metering, ground engagement and mining are all categories where the white irons shine.  Iron products can be painted, plated and machined. Solidification modeling is readily used by iron foundries to precisely define mold and part development.

255,3,"CSI Home CSI Matrix Metals Processes CSI Galleries CSI Team Contact Our Contact STEEL Steel is another heavily alloyed material allowing it to cost effectively cover many different product applications. Steel components are produced via the powdered metal/MIM process, as well as sand and investment casting. High strength, toughness, abrasion and wear resistance are typical reasons for specing steel in your applications. ​ Per usual powdered metal gives you the finest surface finish and closest near net shape of the processes. Casting allows you to make 100k pound parts and beyond! ​ All typical secondary capabilities can be performed including paint, plating,polishing, heat treat and machining. Machining runs a bit slower due to the general toughness of the material. Production tooling follows the same path as the other noted materials we have been discussing. Up front solidification modeling is great first step when analyzing your specific part needs. Phone: 262-377-4553PO Box 11Cedarburg, WI 53012 © 2019 Casting Solutions ",1040

Built to Last At the end of the 19th century, cast iron lighting fixtures and poles (lampposts) became popular because the structural stability and longevity was greater than the early fabricated copper, brass, or tin fixtures and wooden poles. Our company casts light weight non-corrosive aluminum alloys to further increase the structural stability and longevity of our products. A urethane mastic coating is applied to our products for superior gloss and color retention that is highly weather resistant. Black is the standard, however, the color of your choice is available. Fasteners are stainless steel or brass. Low Maintenance The transparent light panels are sealed and the brass condensation vents are covered with drain screens to prevent outside elements from entering the fixtures interior, reducing the frequency of cleaning. The light is opened with a single captured screw and hinges between the top and bottom case to allow easy access for lamp maintenance and cleaning.

We understand that delivering certified ingot is more than just meeting price, it's adding expertise to every melt."" —Mike Buyarski, Chief Operating Officer Certified Ingot Brass and Bronze Alloys for Any Casting Yes, I'd like to talk more about our metal needs! Leading the Industry Old-School IntegrityCutting-Edge Innovation federalmetal 595 Excited to announce that #aluminum industry veteran Scott Woods has joined Federal Metal as lead buyer of aluminum copper radiators (ACRs) to supply our multiple processing facilities. His tremendous skill, experience, judgement and relationships will further strengthen our already-talented commercial team. Mar 17 Huge news for Federal Metal today! In response to the growing demand for refined #copper and 1100 #aluminum, we are opening a new, much larger facility in North Little Rock, #Arkansas to expand our processing capacity of post-consumer aluminum copper radiators (ACRs) and production of our proprietary PSA®020 Aluminum and high-grade copper products.Special thanks to the Arkansas Economic Development Commission for all their help in this venture.https://bit.ly/3Tl1EfP Mar 16 Always something really interesting to see around here.#prettycool Mar 15 Federal Metal had a wonderful time at the #AcademyAwards this weekend. Literally.⠀⠀UAP, a global leader in the delivery of bespoke art and design projects, carefully crafts each of the 50 beautiful, gold plated #Oscar statuettes presented to the winners.

Phillies phan. Oh, and he`s also a great leader in our receiving department, overseeing more than 1 million pounds of inbound scrap every week. We`re lucky to have such a quick thinker and strong problem solver on our team. Mar 13 Copper makes the world go `round!Well, in our eyes it sure does. Seriously, take away all the #copper and imagine what that looks like. Mar 10 Our #maintenance team continues to grow in both numbers and expertise.

Mar 9 Great people know great people. That`s why we incentivize our team to refer their friends and colleagues. Any new #hires, referred by a current team member, that remain #employed for 90 days earn the referrer a $500 bonus. When they make it to 180 days, that`s worth another $500!

Mar 6 Is #copper a critical mineral? We sure think so. And so does the Copper Development Association. America’s future depends on copper, and it meets every component of the U.S. Geological Survey’s definition of a Critical Mineral. Now more than ever. We`re fully behind the initiative to make sure copper is recognized as such.⠀https://bit.ly/3EQ7yj8 Mar 3 Copper Today: Sustainability⠀⠀Recycled #copper has exactly the same quality and benefits of newly mined copper, yet it requires as much as 90 percent LESS energy to produce.

356,9,"Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking The UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (‘UK Act’) signalled a new drive in the international fight against modern slavery and human trafficking. The UK Act requires all UK companies to disclose steps taken to ensure that such loathsome practices are not taking place within Radius Aerospace UK Ltd or in our supply chain. The UK Act itself does not impose any specific requirements other than this disclosure obligation. Radius Aerospace UK Ltd may adopt such policies and procedures as deemed appropriate to the nature of our business and that of our supply chain partners. In keeping with our own high standards as an organization, we have elected to follow a proactive yet simple, common sense approach: Be aware: What is modern slavery and human trafficking? Take a moment to read about it here:https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/modern-slavery. Sadly, even today there are unscrupulous people who will take advantage of others who are disadvantaged. Just because a worker seems to have freedom of movement on the job does not mean they are not enslaved in the modern sense; language barriers or fear of abuse may prevent a person from helping themselves escape an abusive situation. Keep alert: Everyone should keep alert internally and when dealing with suppliers. Many of us will have the opportunity to make observations when visiting a supplier’s premises. More frequently all of us come into contact with service providers such as cleaning services and other contractors who attend our premises. Accept no excuses: Never look the other way for the sake of convenience or short‐term profit considerations. If taking action causes inconvenience or additional expense, do it. You will be rewarded for doing the right thing. Report any concern: Do not hesitate to report any concern at once to the HR Department.

There are no threads to weaken the joint, and the full depth of the cup of the fitting is brazed to the tube. Flagg-Flow Type “A” Fittings have a streamlined interior. This interior design reduces turbulence. Close tolerances in the machining of the cups ensure rigid support and a thorough bond. Flagg-Flow Fittings (MIL-DTL-1183), when properly brazed to pipe or tubing, provide a connection which is stronger than the pipe or fitting. Our development engineers can design, manufacture and test new products and we are Level 1 Qualified. The Flagg-Flow Weld (FF-W) copper nickel were developed in 1990 to answer the Navy’s requirement for a class 400 CuNi Socket Weld Fitting. Our engineers worked very closely with NAVSEA and the major shipyards to coordinate the product evaluation and testing requirements.In 1992, the U.S. Navy approved the FF-W products for use wherever Class 200 or 700 CuNi tubing to MIL-T-16420 is permitted.

454,3,"Large, Complex Castings Skilled craftspeople take your largest designs and safely produce impressive, quality castings. In the world of modern manufacturing, removing “skill” from the production equation is a highly sought-after ideal, in order to drive labor costs down. For castings produced on our Floor, this simply isn’t economical without high production quantities supporting the need for automation. Due to this reality, much of our competition is either unwilling or unable to mold in this manner. We have both green sand and no-bake capabilities to ensure we can provide the appropriate service for you. Green sand is the most cost effective but more complex, tighter tolerance or visually critical parts can be produced in no-bake sand to better control geometry and/or surface finish. As with Roto-lift molding, lead times for raw castings produced on The Floor flow around the 16-20 week range, due to the time required to produce a single casting coupled with the fact that we are an industry leader in this area.

454,6,"Advantages Advantages of Aluminum Sand Casting Process The sand casting process offers many distinct advantages when compared to alternative metal casting methods. When the versatility, unit costs, quality, availability and all other factors are considered, using sand molds for manufacturing aluminum castings is the clear choice. Aluminum parts cast in sand molds, and which will be machined, are highly competitive with gray iron, notwithstanding the higher cost per pound of material. The following represents some of the clear advantages of the aluminum sand casting process. Flexibility of DesignIntricately cored parts and parts with feet, bosses or other unwieldy protuberances can be cast soundly. Wide Range of Alloys and Properties AvailableProperties range from 16k to 50k tensile with varying degrees of machinability, corrosion resistance, etc. Lowest Tooling Cost – Shortest Lead TimeUnmachined patterns are cheaper and faster to build lower overall the overall cost of casting production and shortening turn-around time. Long Tool LifeThe aluminum sand casting process uses expendable molds. Hot metal, which causes deterioration of permanent-mold tooling and adversely affects quality of the cast parts, never touches the tooling (pattern). High Production Rates for Large Range of PartsThe many molding options available to sandcasters, from squeeze jolt machines to high pressure automatic molding machines, combined with the use of multi-impression matchplates, permits the manufacture of thousands of parts per day. Ease of Product ModificationWith shorter “Life of Product” cycles than in the past, the ease of altering tooling is increasingly important. Least Sensitive Gating, Feeding and Heat Removal System in Mass ProductionPouring temperatures in permanent molds should be held to +/- 20° for optimum results. In sand, good castings can normally be obtained with temperature differences as high as +/- 40% and generally in a much lower temperature range. High Density Molds Produce Good Surface FinishHigher mold squeeze pressures combined with technological improvements in sand preparation produce castings with a surface finish that rivals the permanent mold processes.

454,9,"Roto-Lift Molding  Perfect for Medium Size Sand Castings For castings larger than our 32 x 32” Sinto can produce, we have two semi-automatic Roto-lift molding centers to ensure many larger castings can be safely produced with production-line quality and efficiency. The weight, core complexity/placement and specific dimensions of your design dictate whether the Roto-lift is a good fit. If you have the opportunity to view a great operator mold on a roto-lift, I recommend you take it; it is one of those tasks in life that an experienced, prideful individual can make look easy but, somehow, you recognize that isn’t the case without ever having molded yourself. Due to our reputation in this area and a significant backlog regardless of market conditions or time of year, lead times for raw castings produced on our Roto-lifts are typically in the 8-12 week range. Flask sizes ranging from 18”x24” through 32”x70” extend the capabilities across a broad range of configurations. Typically, castings produced on our roto-lifts range from 30-100 pounds.

457,10,"219-362-8531 The Shell Mold Process  Hiler Industries boasts two modern foundries that produce millions of castings every year â all using the shell mold process. Since 1946, we have been providing our customers the highest quality castings, in a variety of metals, all with an excellent surface finish and near-net shape. Superior Machining QualitiesA major benefit of shell molding is the excellent machining characteristics achieved through this process. Many photomicrograph inspections have shown that shell castings have what might be termed âcooling rate inversion.â Unlike green sand castings, permanent mold and die castings â which all have hard skins and âsoftâ interiors â shell mold castings have âsoftâ skins and hard or dense interiors. As a result, shell mold castings have superior machining qualities vs. green sand and other types of castings. Less WeightAnother major benefit is that less machining stock is required. Over the years, we have found that .060 stock is more than ample. In fact, if the job were to be machined in our machine shop, we would add only .040 stock. This is helpful in two ways: There have been times when we worked with customers and eliminated machining entirely. General Tolerance Information(Unit of Measure: Inches) Same side of parting line: Add Â± .003 / inch over 3"" Across parting line: Â± .030 for 1st 3"" Â± .003 / inch over 3"" Draft: Typically 1Â° Certain applications at 0Â° draft. Typical Finish Stock: .060"" maximum Hole size cast into part: DIAMETER DEPTH Less than 0.5"" Equal to diameter 0.5"" - 1.0"" Equal to 1.5 times diameter  Note: The above information is modified by the individual casting complexity and to agreement between the customer and Hiler Industries. For example, we have held some dimensions to Â± .010, obtained less than 1Â° draft, and used some finish allowances less than .030. 219-362-8531sales © 2021 Hiler Industries. All rights reserved.

494,2,"Design & Process Guidelines When designing a casting, active participation should take place between the Design Engineer, the casting producer and the machining source. Meloon Foundries LLC does this through direct contact with the casting buyer. Pattern or ToolingA significant variable in the construction of a pattern is the determination of the shrink factor. The shrink factors vary for different metals and also the configuration of the part. The number of impressions, the gating system, the process or methodology will affect the casting cost. This is better left to the foundry and pattern maker to determine. Process GuidelinesIt is important that the foundry and the casting purchaser work closely together in order for the casting producer to make an acceptable cost effective part. Producing a casting for the first time entails a certain amount of trial and error.It is an experienced-based development process. The expertise and past experience with similar casting configurations provide a guideline for the initial production. Usually the more intricate the casting design and the more drastic the change in section thickness the less predictable the casting soundness.This is why it is important to consider location of isolated heavy sections, uniform wall thicknesses and correct placement or ribs and junction design. Visual casting soundness many times is not sufficient to verify acceptability and machining the sample casting prior to production release is important. SpecificationsOver specifying can increase the cost of a casting appreciable. Proper alloy selection, welding permissibility, correct choice of temper, and final inspection criteria all figure into casting cost.Under specifying leads in many cases to misunderstanding between the casting producer and the casting supplier. Castings that are designed for critical applications require specific quality criteria. Selection of material that does not meet environmental or mechanical properties frequently leads to poor casting performance. New Jobs Rapid PrototypingRapid Prototyping is the developing of a temporary pattern or tooling from a 3-D computer design. This temporary tooling reduces casting time from months to days. The computer model is used as the blue-print and its dimensions to produce a model. Any rapid prototype pattern that is durable enough to withstand green sand or no bake molding can be used.

Produces Complicated DesignsWith Flawless Surface Finish Read Advantages... Some Of The Advantages Include: Read Less... SHELL CORE PRODUCTION Shell cores are manufactured with resin-coated silica sand. The cores are hollow and can be                         made in various sizes and configurations.                         We’ve used this procedure within various industries that require precise casting components. Produces Accurate MoldsWith Complex Interior Structure Read Advantages... Core Blowing Advantages: High tolerances The shell cores allow you to maintain applications to high tolerances. Accuracy and automation Shell and core molds are made by molding machines, which can accurately produce                                 innovative aluminum castings with complex inside structures. The main function is                                 performed by the machine and not the worker. Great dimensional accuracy This hard molding material will reduce the swelling of sand molds. Therefore, the                                 dimensional tolerance will be smaller. This advantage will be very useful for producing                                 high-accuracy rough castings, and it can reduce the machining cost. Read Less... NO BAKE CORE PRODUCTION The core blowing automated machine is designed for high-productivity mid-sized components. It                         is highly efficient, produces high-quality components,                         and allows us to price competitively. While most clients appreciate our ability to price projects using our core blowing technique,                         the ability to make higher-quality cores is our main incentive.                         When you allow an operator to manually change recipes, your core’s condition can be expected to                         change. Excessive material can weaken a core                         after metal is poured. Automation eliminates the human error of inconsistent material pours. Produces High QualityComponents At Affordable Pricing Read Advantages... Core Blowing Advantages: Competitive pricing This equipment allows us to compete with lower prices from foundries using                                     traditional methods. Guarantee quality The quality control is built into the machine with the RFID tags, and therefore                                     allows                                     for consistent cast applications. Efficiency Based on our experience, our core blowing system is more efficient when we need to                                     blow                                     multiple core boxes from the same chamber of sand.

532,1,"Service Committed to Total Customer Satisfaction Everyone at Hadronics is dedicated to meeting customer needs as quickly and precisely as possible every day. As soon as we receive a cylinder from a customer,itr gets inspected and estimated, typically within 24 hours and as soon as 60 minutes in special situations. We talk to the customer to determine lead time requirements and will work overtime or weekends to meet a rush delivery. If necessary, we will send a team to the customer’s plant to see first-hand what is happening. Or if needed, we will actually do the repairs in their shop to avoid lengthy disassembly and shipping. Our goal is to respond as quickly and effectively as possible to solve the problem.  Once we receive an approval from the customer, the cylinder is sent into the shop for repair and/or rebuild. Our software keeps a complete history of all work on every cylinder we repair, so the past work is communicated to the shop floor. The applications engineering team then determines the machining, plating, coating, sprays or blend of the three that will restore the cylinder to top operating condition.  Once the repairs are complete and the cylinder passes final inspection, the shipping is tracked until the roller is in the customer’s shop and back in production.

Case Studies In finishing before topcoat Repaired and ready to run Challenge:A medium-sized carton printer in the Midwest recently experienced extensive damage to its impression, blanket and plate cylinders caused by a hold down breaking and falling into the press, rendering the press inoperable. The printer had heavy production schedules to meet and needed to get back in operation quickly, so they called Hadronics for emergency repairs.  Solution:Hadronics application engineer visited the printer to see the problem first hand. After examining the press and talking to the production personnel, it was determined that the cylinders could be repaired on the press by using a combination of welding, hand work and portable plating. The repairs were completed and the press was back in operation in just one week , compared to two months that would have been necessary if the cylinders had to be pulled from the press.  The Facility Manager wrote a letter to Hadronics commenting, “Hadronics responded in lightning speed and worked within our production schedule to complete all repairs.

532,12,"Engineering Combining Innovative Engineering with Years of Hands-On Experience to Improve Your Efficiency The applications engineering team at Hadronics is committed to continuously improving the efficiency of your rollers, cylinders and overall operations through constant innovation. When you send a roller to Hadronics, we first do a detailed visual inspection of the unit to determine the extent of the damage. We then look at the history of repairs for that cylinder and customer to gain more insight into possible solutions. The customer is contacted and interviewed to determine the cause of the problem and to review the operations surrounding the particular cylinder and the turnaround time needed.  Once the engineering team has gathered all the background information, we decide on the machining, plating, coating, sprays or blend of the three that will restore the cylinder to top operating condition. Hadronics strives to actually improve the wear characteristics, durability and efficiency of the cylinder by taking steps to widen the operational window of the cylinder to provide more flexibility in manufacturing. Before returning the cylinder to the customer, Hadronics does a detailed final inspection to ensure the concentricity, orbital rotation, surface finish and all other parameters are within specifications.

In the United States, women make up 47% of the general workforce, but only account for about 30% of those employed in manufacturing industries.  This statistic has not changed much in decades and mirrors Gibbs’ experience.  Census data shows that those who work in manufacturing earn over 21% more than the median income and women in manufacturing make 16% more than the median for women.  With the current labor shortage, now is the perfect time for women to think about pursuing a career in manufacturing and all the jobs associated with it which include IT, finance, engineering, supply chain, sales, and more.

588,4,"Permanent Mold Process Melling Engineered Aluminum Castingshas four gravity fed tilt pour permanent mold machines that employ both permanent and  semi-permanent cores for production. Permanent mold casting process has re-useable molds that are typically cast iron or coated with refractory coatings. Different types of coatings are used for insulating, chilling, lubricating, and releasing properties. After the coatings have been applied the mold is heated to production temperature, and Aluminum is then poured into ‘pour cups’ on the mold. The machine tilts the cavity from horizontal to vertical, filling the runners and casting cavity from the bottom. After a period of solidification the machine tilts back to horizontal and ejects the casting. Permanent mold casting provides improved surface finish, and dimensional accuracy compared to sand casting. Other advantages of permanent mold include forced directional solidification, finer grain structure and reduced wall thickness.

588,5,"Shell cores are ideal for light castings when the weight is critical and to provide increase dimensional controls and surface finish compared to other core production processes. Shell Core Process The shell core process is a hot box operation. The cast iron box is heated to operating temperature and resin coated sand is blown into the box. The heat cures  the resin and binds the sand grains creating a shell. The longer the cure, the thicker the shell. Sand Identification Core sand is classified based on the American Foundry Society  Grain Fineness Number and the resin content. Both the fineness and resin  content heavily influence the type of sand used in a specific part. Melling Engineered Aluminum Castings determines sand type based on customer requirements and casting process  criteria to ensure a quality core and ultimately a sound casting. Assembly Process Part specific, engineered assembly fixtures designed for  repeatability, efficiency, and full communication between components.  Cores are produced individually then combined as a “core pack.”  Assemblies can utilize internal/external chaplets, hot set glue, solvent  paste and compression techniques. The goal of the assembly design and  process is to minimize necessary manufacturing aids (i.e. chaplets,  etc.). Cores are ready to be placed into molds as one unit after  assembly.Utilizing the core assembly process we can reduce the cycle time, the potential for defects in the casting, and reduce the cost of your casting.

599,3,"Materials and alloys Brass Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Altering the copper or zinc percentage, along with other elements, changes the properties of the brass. Brass is “softer” than ferrous metals and is easily machined with less tool wear; it also has high corrosion resistance. Wam Metals does have a Foundry and we are able to alloy brass material to nearly any specification. Common use: Gas valves, taps, fire hydrants, locks, wire clamps, nuts, bolts, geyser parts. Here is a list of quality brass materials that Wam Metals manufactures regularly. Stamping Brass Specification: CW617N This brass alloy is used for all general brass type parts. The forgings are tight-grained which makes them very suitable for high and low pressure gas applications. DZR Brass Specification: CW602N De-Zincification Resistant (DZR) brass is used in the plumbing industry for taps, geyser parts, element bosses and fire hydrant parts. DZR is recommended for applications where the part is in contact with running water. Naval Brass Specification: CW712R A high tensile brass with excellent corrosion resistance. Ideal for specialised fasteners. Aluminium Bronze Aluminium Bronze (AB2) A hard wearing metal used in applications as valve guides and seats, corrosion resistant parts and bushing gears. Aluminium Bronze is not suitable for use with strong oxidising acids. Aluminium Nickel Zinc Bronze Commonly known as XX, Aluminium Nickel Zinc Bronze is a sand and continuous cast material used in the glass mould industry. Copper Copper is extremely ductile and malleable whether hot or cold; it is also an excellent conductor of electricity and heat.Use: Switchgear, transformers, wiring, water pipes, earthing Wam Metals does have a Foundry and we are able to manufacture copper material to nearly any specification.Here is a list of quality copper materials that Wam Metals manufactures regularly: High Conductivity Copper Specification: CW021A Used in the electrical sector for forged shapes and busbar. Copper Nickel Silicon Specification: CW112L Used in the railway sector for applications that require high tensile strength. For more information on Copper, visitWikipedia – Copper.

604,4," FBLC - Fixtures, Bases, Legs & Components The Wolverine Bronze Company's Fixture Bases, Legs and Components have been the leader in standardized details since the 1970's. Originally designed by a domestic automotive manufacturer who had the foresight to realize that checking fixture costs and quality would benefit from standardizing common details such as angles, risers and drop assemblies in building checking fixture tools. The benefits include: economy of scale, higher quality standards through consistent machining techniques and reduced tool construction time. The products, originally marketed under the Artco name and acquired by Wolverine Bronze Company in 1971, have gone from the standard of one company to the standard of companies all over the world. The Artco name was dropped in the early eighties and the products became known as Wolverine Standard Components and Fixture Bases. With the advent of this web site we are introducing the FBLC products division. The product line was expanded over the nineties to meet changing demand. A metric version of the line was added and steel components became available. Today these details are available in aluminum with English or metric dimensions and steel with English or metric dimensions.

Technical Plating's environmental compliance staff keep an open line of communication with officials from the city, county, state, and the EPA on an ongoing basis to find ways reduce waste, recycle products and metals, and reduce water consumption.  Technical Plating is extremely committed to treating and returning the water from our processes back to the environment cleaner than when it came to our facility through our  flow through water treatment department. This was  designed to meet our specific plating needs and allows us to treat all of our different processes in the same treatment area. The metals in the water are precipitated out, and then dewatered through a filter press and turned into a sludge which is the main waste that we produce. That material is then recycled. Water treatment is monitored to ensure we are in compliance with rules and regulations set by our local and federal regulators. The water treatment operators are well trained, and continue to update their knowledge as the waste industry becomes more advanced. All metal and plating process materials are conflict free as well.  Technical Plating  takes environmental and safety regulations very seriously and will continue to improve our environmental  initiatives and provide our customers with the highest quality plating solutions, which is what TPI is known for.

We have the knowledge and experience to develop and implement quality systems in the manufacturing environment, that will fully capitalize on these benefits. The successful implementation of any complete quality system requires input and involvement by various disciplines within a management team, this is because of the fact that in today business, a quality system includes everything from reviewing the customer contract to preventive maintenance of your machinery.

In order to fully manage this process you must be conscious of the interactions of numerous variables and gain a complete understanding of the thermal transfer cycles that take place within the relatively short cycle of a die casting machine. In this business, there is no substitute for experience, experience is the only teacher that will enable a person to fully understand what it takes to produce a quality die casting. AtAppalachian Cast Products,we are diecasters with decades of experience. While our skills cover many disciplines, we recognize and understand that the bottom line in this business depends primarily on our ability to provide our customers with top quality casting, on time, and at a price that is competitive in this industry. We also realize that competitive pricing is not a result of scrimping on equipment or technology, but is accomplished by utilizing the latest in technologies to increase efficiencies and simply out perform the competition. Toward this end we will utilize the latest in die casting equipment, set up in a efficient “cell” arrangement to assure that every activity is optimized and that the efficiency of our equipment and personnel is at the highest level in the industry. As with all process, success in die casting relies on the development of a process which is capable of producing a quality product, studying and truly understanding that process, and continuously monitoring that process to assure that the parameters established are maintained and consistent. Additionally, such a process must be managed in an atmosphere of continuous improvement and team work. A strong team must be built to assure that all personnel remain focused on the task of providing our customers with the highest level of products and services. The technological advances in the die casting industry over the last several years have allow diecasters to fully understand our process and continuously strive for improvements in quality and efficiency. The elements of the die cast cell have change over the years to include robotics for molten metal delivery, application of die release agents, and extraction of castings from the mold. In addition to these refinements we are also dedicated  to the use of process monitoring and control equipment to assure that our processes are consistently maintained.

639,5,"Carburized Thin Wall Sleeve Bearing At SC Industries, we have earned a reputation among customers in a number of industries for our ability to machine precision thin-walled components with proportionally large diameters. This carburized thin wall bearing sleeve was machined for a customer in the off-road construction and mining equipment industry. As with any rotating component, bearings must be machined precisely to ensure proper operation of the machinery in which it is to be used. If tolerances are not met, the bearing can cause vibration, which not only leads to failure of the bearing itself, but premature wear of other mechanical components. The bearing shown here has an outer diameter of 9.4″, an inner diameter of 8.9″, and a length of 4″. Dimensional tolerances as tight as ± 0.0004″ and a surface finish of 32 µin were achieved by utilizing the capabilities of our CNC lathe in conjunction with precision grinding equipment. The bearings were machined in accordance with customer provided prints and heat treated using a tightly controlled process to carburize the part to the specified depth without causing distortion. For this project, we manufactured a total of 100 sleeve bearings with a turnaround time of 4 weeks. For additional details regarding this precision CNC machining project, see the table below, orcontact us directly.

We have been known as the “Bushing Specialists,” which is why customers in the heavy-duty vehicle industry continually engage us to provide long-wearing, high-reliability products. In the following project, we fabricated this hardened steel bearing bushing for use in mining equipment. Constructed from 521000 bearing steel for its hardness and wear properties, it featured dimensions of 7-1/4″ in length x 6-1/2″ in width x 7-7/8″ in height. Close tolerance precision machining resulted in a high level of dimensional integrity, and a secondary centerless grinding process enabled us to achieve accuracies of ±0.0004″ as well as a 16 RMS surface finish. Our unsurpassed understanding of metal properties and characteristics enabled us to heat treat the component to a uniform hardness with no distortion to the workpiece. In addition to hardness testing, we applied quality assurance using precision calibrated digital gages to accurately measure the I.D and height. In the field, the low friction surface combined with outstanding hardness properties provided a high-reliability and low maintenance solution for this rugged and demanding environment. Today, we continue to produce this product in various quantities. If you are interested in learning more about this project, you cancontact us today.

652,7,"Media Blast Cleaning Media Blast Cleaning Stegman Tool’s Media Blasting Cleaning can solve multiple types of surface preparation and pretreatment requirements: Media Types Glass Bead– Material often used on surfaces such as stainless steel, brass, or bronze to remove weld slag, buildup, or brighten the existing surface before sealing. Glass bead is less abrasive than the traditional grit media and has light deburring. Provides a satin finish with glare removal properties. Aluminum Oxide– Aluminum Oxide Grit is a sharp, long-lasting abrasive sandblasting cutting media. As an abrasive blasting media, it is harder than most common dry abrasive blast media and will cut even the hardest metals and surfaces Steel Shot/Peen– Steel shot or shot peen is manufactured into a round ball shape that results in a smooth and polished surface. The peening action of the steel shot produces improved compressive strength to metal surfaces. Walnut Shell– Used as an economical, biodegradable alternative for sensitive blasting operations that require aggressive stripping without effect on the surface of the base material. Plastic Beads– Deliver quick stripping rates and consistent performance while remaining non-abrasive. This media is ideal for stripping coatings and paint from substrates, including aluminum and other delicate metals, composites and plastics. The relative softness of plastic abrasive media makes it ideal for automotive and aerospace blasting applications. Our various hand cabinets can accommodate all small to mid-size parts with tumble and basket blasters for batch processing.

674,3," Investment         Casting Process  Conventional Shell Casting Investment casting, or the ""lost wax"" process         has been in use since the construction of the first pyramid. The Egyptians         and Chinese used the process in their early history to make statues and         jewelry. The investment casting method was largely ignored as an industrial         process for the fabrication of parts until the demand for rapidly finished         parts during World War II created the need for ""near net-shape"" components         that could readily be put into their final form. At this time new inorganic         high temperature ceramic mold binders were developed to industrialize         the process applications to include high strength and corrosion resistant         materials such as low to high carbon alloy steel, tool steel, stainless         steel, and nickel and cobalt base alloys. Aluminum and brass alloys are         available also. It is a process capable of producing intricate shapes weighing         from a small fraction of an ounce up to forty pounds or more. Some examples         would be: dental appliances, jewelry, components for the automotive industry,         military weaponry, jet engines, aircraft structural parts, machinery         components, and many others. In general, an injection molded wax pattern         is used for each part produced which is then encased in multiple layers         of ceramic material. The wax pattern is then removed from the ceramic         shell mold. The mold is fired in an oven and then molten metal is poured         into the cavities left by the evacuated wax pattern. Upon cooling, the         resulting precision castings are cleaned and subjected to further processing         such as heat treatment. At this point, many parts are in their final form         and are ready for use while others may require a small amount of further         processing such as machining before reaching their final form. Because         we build our ceramic molds exclusively by hand, we specialize in producing         complex detail, which is not always possible for foundries that utilize         robots. Our cosmetics are as good as any foundry can offer, better than         most. Chicago Vacuum produces castings with an exceptionally smooth finish,         typical dimension accuracy of +/- .005” and the capabilities of holding         as close as +/-.003” when         required. Our production lead times are among the shortest in the industry,         and our quality system is based upon MIL-I-45208 with an ongoing objective         of becoming ISO-9002 compliant throughout our facility. We also have the capabilities         of furnishing secondary operations such as machining, non destructive testing,         plating, coating, heat treat, and assembly. We also subcontract the construction         of molding tools which are produced from 7075-T651 aircraft aluminum quality.         We also employ a uniqueSolid Mold Process.  <Back|Top|Home ©2005Chicago Vacuum Casting3400 South Nevada Street | Milwaukee, WI 53207 | (414) 483-7111 | Fax: (414) 483-7192 | email:salesdept@chicagovac.comSister Company:Milwaukee Precision Casting ",3206
674,4," Design Examples Chicago Vacuum Casting has partnered with several companies to produce         high quality investment casts. Often these companies have turned to us         to help reduce material and labor costs, while producing a quality part.         Below are a few examples of casts we have produced for our customers. Exceptional Quality   BEFOREThese two-iron parts were produced using the sand-casting process. Several secondary     machining operations were required to properly fit carbide drilling inserts     into the internal detail of the parts. Notice the rough finish and lack of     detail. AFTERChicago Vacuum Casting reduced the machining operation cost for these two parts     by using the investment casting process. These parts were cast to net shape,     eliminating all machining operations. Cast from high strength steel alloy,     these parts now have superior detail - see the detail in the part number. Exceptional         Detail Chicago Vacuum Casting can also give your designs freedom when producing           precision small parts. This example has twelve .020 diameter holes           at the top of the part. We were able to accomplish the very fine detail           through the investment casting process.   <Back|Top|Home ©2005Chicago Vacuum Casting3400 South Nevada Street | Milwaukee, WI 53207 | (414) 483-7111 | Fax: (414) 483-7192 | email:salesdept@chicagovac.comSister Company:Milwaukee Precision Casting ",1447
674,5," Investment Casting History Investment Castings in Lost Wax The 	    origin of the investment casting process, also known as the lost wax 	    process, stretches back in time to 1100/1700 BC. Works of art were created 	    from hand sculptured wax patterns with delicate detail as sophisticated 	    as any precision investment casting produced today. Industrial America paid little heed to the capabilities of Investment           Castings in Lost Wax until WWII, when sudden military demands overtaxed           the machine tool industry. By injecting wax into a permanent-molding           die to form a pattern, investment casting became the solution for many         complex parts that were required in staggering quantities. During the 	      postwar period, this process has evolved and expanded into virtually 	    every industry and marketplace, as seen today. Chicago Vacuum Casting has 	    become a leader in the manufacturing of Investment Castings in lost wax.  <Back|Top|Home ©2005Chicago Vacuum Casting3400 South Nevada Street | Milwaukee, WI 53207 | (414) 483-7111 | Fax: (414) 483-7192 | email:salesdept@chicagovac.comSister Company:Milwaukee Precision Casting ",1179

674,9," CVC Advantages Looking 	    for cost savings? Investment casting may be the answer. Sand Castings, 	    forgings, weldments, fabrications, and machined components are frequently 	    converted to investment casting to reduce cost. Often, investment casting       is the ONLY way a part can be manufactured economically. When properly applied, 	    our advancing technology can offer complex ""near         net-shapes"" that reduce overall manufacturing costs by minimizing         material and labor inputs. Parts designs can be lighter in weight, more         complex and are available in a wider range of alloys than those offered         by other processes. Stronger materials, better surface finishes, thinner         walls, difficult internal configurations and closer tolerances than those         available through alternate processing techniques are some of the other       advantages of the investment casting process. Our management team has         extensive experience in the investment casting industry. We operate under         a single tier management system, which allows us to be responsive to         the customer’s needs. A significant portion         of our growth is derived from customers that have moved tooling to us         from other foundries, where they had experienced chronic quality and/or       delivery problems.  <Back|Top|Home ©2005Chicago Vacuum Casting3400 South Nevada Street | Milwaukee, WI 53207 | (414) 483-7111 | Fax: (414) 483-7192 | email:salesdept@chicagovac.comSister Company:Milwaukee Precision Casting ",1549
674,10," General Tolerances There has been a lot of discussion over the years between various suppliers         of investment castings regarding tolerance that is appropriate for the         process. While there continues to be some debate, what follows is meant         to be a general guideline. An investment casting is meant to be a ""near         net-shape"" part that offers the most value. If the buyer and producer         maintain a high level of communication, the design requirements and cost       efficiencies will be met by processing capabilities. RadiiThe general tolerance is +/- 1/64”, although if necessary we             can reduce this to a span of 0.005”. For best results and lowest             costs, allow a generous radius, and avoid sharp corners. Straightness & FlatnessCastings are mechanically straightened when necessary.Tolerances for flatness and straightness are .003” to .005” TIR           per linear inch and depend on alloy and configuration of casting. RoundnessThe general linear tolerance of +/- .005” applies to diameters.             On larger tubular castings, closer tolerances can be held through           mechanical straightening. HolesTolerances for holes are as follows:  The following table gives you the amount of eccentricity you               can expect in an investment casting. AnglesThe angular tolerance should not be closer than +/- 1/2 ”.  <Back|Top|Home ©2005Chicago Vacuum Casting3400 South Nevada Street | Milwaukee, WI 53207 | (414) 483-7111 | Fax: (414) 483-7192 | email:salesdept@chicagovac.comSister Company:Milwaukee Precision Casting ",1593
674,11," Geometric Tolerances There has been a lot of discussion over the years between various suppliers         of investment castings regarding tolerance that is appropriate for the         process. While there continues to be some debate, what follows is meant         to be a general guideline. An investment casting is meant to be a ""near         net-shape"" part that offers the most value. If the buyer and producer         maintain a high level of communication, the design requirements and cost       efficiencies will be met by processing capabilities. Straightness,             Roundness, & Positioning (holes or bosses)Axial straightness, roundness (bar or tube shapes) and positioning of holes   or bosses is generally tolerance as +/-.005 per inch. ConcentricityThe center of a bore to the outside diameter of a part will be concentric within     .003"" for each 1/2"" of wall thickness. Note, this assumes measurements     are taken in the same plane and does not include out of roundness tolerance. AngularityAs is the case with other dimensional tolerances for castings, the as-cast     angle tolerance is largely a function of the part design. In general, a tolerance     of +/-1/2 degree is considered minimum. Blind Holes and SlotsThese features are generally cast provided the depth is equal to the width     or diameter for small characteristics less than 3/8"". As the size increases     above 3/8"", the depth can move incrementally to double the size of the     opening. FlatnessThis feature of casting is measured as the distance between two parallel planes,     within which, the entire surface of the part must lie. Once again, the actual     shape of the part will largely influence the cooling behavior of the wax     pattern and the part as it solidifies; and this, in turn, tends to govern     process capability.

716,1,"About Us Trusted for over 80 years On 15 April 1937, two partners – Alexander Dingwall and William Price – decided to start a steel foundry that would supply South Africa’s growing mining industry. At the time, Alexander’s daughter, Mary, was engaged to William’s son, Les Price. To mark the joining of the two families and the launch of a family business, the partners combined the names ‘Price’ and ‘Mary’ to form the name PRIMA Iron and Steel Foundry and Engineering Works (Pty) Ltd. They may not have known it at the time but, on that day, the founding partners – both in their sixties and planning for retirement – established what would become one of South Africa’s oldest and most established family-owned foundries. 50 to 1,000 in 80 years Production started in 1938, on a five-acre piece of land in Benoni, South Africa. With just one two-ton electric arc furnace, PRIMA cast an average of 50 tons per month of iron and steel castings for replacement wear parts. A lot changed in the next eight decades. Today, PRIMA occupies over 16 acres of land and has a monthly casting capacity of over 1,000 tons, with exports into all of the major mining regions. We provide a full spectrum of design, manufacturing, and after-sales services, with a focus on the global supply of grinding mill liners and crusher wear parts. But one thing hasn’t changed.

781,2,"Brass Metal Stampings, Bronze Metal Stampings, Nickel Silver Metal Stampings Brass Metal Stampings There are more than 400 copper alloys, each with a unique combination of properties, to suit many applications, manufacturing processes and environments.Brass is the generic term for a range of copper-zinc alloys with differing combinations of properties, including strength, machinability, ductility, wear-resistance, hardness, color, hygienic, electrical and thermal conductivity, and corrosion-resistance. Common brass alloys used at New England Precision include UNS Brass is often used in the key and lock hardware industry for its machinability.  It is also highly used in the fire protection industry for its excellent thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance.  Copper is alloyed mostly with zinc.  The lower UNS numbers have higher copper content which improves corrosion resistance, thermal conductivity and solder ability.  Generally speaking; higher zinc content improves strength.  C35000 and C35300 contain lead for machinability. Reference ASTM B152/B 152M specification for details: (Nominal percentages, based on weight)  Nickel Silver Metal Stampings These silver colored copper-nickel-zinc alloys containing 10-20% nickel can be regarded as special brasses. In most respects they show similar corrosion characteristics to the brasses, but the higher nickel versions have superior tarnish resistance and resistance to stress corrosion cracking.

844,4,"Since 1949… Started in 1949 by two innovative, tinkering brothers named Lynn and Russ (LR). These brothers had lived through the Great Depression and World War II and throughout their lives had developed a driving curiosity about how things worked. So they combined their experience and started Marco Products which focused on building unique products for local industrial customers. This new found adventure enabled them to tinker and also support their young, growing families. Marco Products eventually became Lynrus Corporation when they brought on investors in the late 1960’s then at the turn of the century became Lynrus Aluminum Products when Russ Margetts, Russ Senior’s son, took over operations of the business. After nearly 20 years of exciting growth and new opportunities, Russ sold the company to his son Tyler who is the current owner. In the transition of ownership the company started anew as LR Dynamics. “LR” hails back to the original founders Lynn and Russ and represents a stewardship of a great legacy of hard work and innovation. “Dynamics” represents forward motion and positive change that is the goal of the third generation of family owners.

856,0,"   Welcome Aboard Algonac Marine Cast has been in business since its inception in 1923, and has continually grown over the decades, providingcraftsmanship products to the boating industry. Today it operates under Marine Hardware Inc., a Redmond, Washington company in a facility that spans 55,000 square feet with total in house capabilities from Design to Cad to Foundry to Machining to Inspection to Shipping, all under one roof. With a current inventory of over 10,000 patterns, drawings and documentation and a completely integrated facility that includes in house pattern making, machine shop and foundry we have all the tools in place to be a valued supplier to all the current boat builders today and those parts will like all the others be valued treasures for boat restorers for many years to come.   ",810
856,1,"   History Algonac Cast Products is an outgrowth of E.E. Warner & Sons, a building supply firm established in 1911. Captain Warner took an active part in the business when he retired from sailing in 1920 and in 1923, a foundry was added to supply marine hardware to boat manufacturers.   The foundry was located near the site where Chris Craft Boats were first built by Chris Smith and his family around the turn of the century, and long relationships were established with other boat builders such as Gar Wood, Sea Ray and almost every boat building company in the world.     In 1946, the business was incorporated under the name of Algonac Foundry Company and in the late 1940’s moved to a new, larger building covering over 51,000 square feet of manufacturing space producing non-ferrous castings for Industrial and Marine customers.  In January 2015, Algonac Cast was purchased Marine Hardware Inc., a Redmond, Washington based company and was renamed Algonac Marine Cast, reflecting its core business focusing on the marine industry. With an huge inventory of OEM patterns, these are original – not reproductions. After purchasing Algonac Marine Cast llc, the immediate goal was to re-kindle the OEM business that always was the economic engine of its success and at the same time continue to preserve its rich history With a current inventory of over 10,000 patterns, drawings and documentation and a completely integrated facility that includes in house pattern making, machine shop and foundry we have all the tools in place to be a valued supplier to all the current boat builders today and those parts will like all the others be valued treasures for boat restorers for many years to come.

As Westport’s Supply Chain Services and Logistics Customers continued to expand, our company’s core business of Axle Assembly also grew. That same year Westport opened a 205,000 square foot Axle Assembly facility in Roanoke, Virginia providing service to Volvo. Also in 2008, Westport again expanded and opened a Manufacturing Division in Louisville, Kentucky where we machine components for the commercial vehicles market. In the summer of 2012, Westport opened up a Chassis Assembly Plant in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania servicing Mack. To date, the 3 divisions of Westport continue to thrive.

United P&H Receives 100th Year Anniversary Award from the Milwaukee County Historical Society  ",986
946,1,"The History of United P&HSupply Company United Plumbing & Heating Supply Company,founded by George J. Roska Sr. and two partners,  arrived on the Milwaukee  scene in 1922—selling exclusively to plumbing and heating contractors. An  outgoing and industrious man, George headed the company as president and sales  manager. He died suddenly in 1932, leaving the majority stock to his wife and  young children. Throughout the Great Depression and World War II, Mrs. Roska  held on to that stock, although the family could have avoided much hardship by  selling it. George's son, George Jr.,worked for the company after high school  graduation in 1938. When World War II broke out, he and his brother, Roy, joined the armed  services. Roy  was a Marine fighter pilot, and George Jr. served in the U.S. Army Air Corps.  After they were discharged, the two men, and brother Norm, purchased the stock  of the minority partners and took over management of the business. Roy became President and  Sales Manager; George, General Manager and Secretary-Treasurer; Norm,  Vice-President and Warehouse Manager. Under the leadership of the three  brothers, United grew steadily during the 50's. In 1962, United added an Industrial Division,headed by Roy,  to sell pipe, valves, fittings (PVF) and related products to manufacturers,  utilities, institutions and municipalities in the Greater Milwaukee Area. Following graduation  from Texas Christian  University,four years of service in the Naval Air Reserve  and a short stint in public relations, George Jr.’s son,Chip, joined United's Industrial Division in 1977, when Roy became seriously ill. To grow the  business, Roy,  George and Chip decided to expand the Industrial Division's operations into the  rest of the state by finding specialty product lines that were unique, employed  selective distribution, and required a high level of sales expertise. When Roy died in 1980, Chip  picked up the torch as Sales Manager. The Industrial Division continued to  prosper. Chip's younger brother, Paul,an Auburn   University graduate,  joined the company in 1981, as Purchasing Manager, after serving as an  Assistant Engineer at a nuclear power plant. His technical background prepared  him to effectively steer United's increased use of computer technology to best  advantage. By 1986, the Industrial  Division had grown enough to spin off a separate Technical  Divisionto market engineered products, including:  high-performance valves, valve automation, steam traps, automatic continuous  blowdown systems, steam specialties, jet pumps, and flow and level instruments,  in Wisconsin and Upper   Michigan. ""Tech"" developed a “Mod Shop” for the  installation of actuators and controls on valves. While the Technical Division  continued to work with much of the Industrial Division’s customer base, it  placed additional focus on the pulp and paper industry in the Fox and Wisconsin River Valleys. Keeping up with the  industry's advancements in computer technology,United switched over to theEclipseoperating platform, in March of 1999. Integrating all facets of the company's  operations, Eclipse also enabled the company to utilize Palm Pilots and bar  coding for Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI). To improve customer service, United  hired a logistics manager, Rick Chojnacki, a Cardinal Stritch   University grad, to  assume responsibility for warehouse logistics, delivery, and to assist with  inventory management and process improvement.  Rick had acquired expertise  in these areas during prior employment with Wisconsin Electric and Master Lock. February 1, 2000, George Roska retiredfrom United P&H after 61 years of service.  He relinquished his roles as President and Treasurer to become chairman of the  board. The board of directors elected Chip Roska, President and General  Manager, and Paul Roska, Vice-President Operations and Inventory Manager. Rick  Chojnackiwas appointed VP-Logistics Design, in July of 2004, to reflect his leadership and  contribution within the company. In June of 2007, Paulmoved to Florida to embark on a new career. In October of 2008, several appointments were made:Rick Chojnacki, VP/Operations and Assistant GM; Tom Hudson, VP-Sales and Industrial Division Manager; and Jeff Zawicki, VP-Purchasing and Plumbing Division Manager. In April of 2014,Rick Chojnacki was appointed President/GM, and Chip Roska, CEO. In  May of 2017,United made the historic decision to close its Plumbing  Division (established in 1922)-- curtailing the sale of plumbing  fixtures, faucets and water heaters, to focus all assets exclusively on  Industrial PVF, Technical Products, and to establish a new Sanitary  Products Group aimed at Wisconsin's prolific Food, Beverage and  Pharmaceutical Markets. Although, the Plumbing Division was shut  down, United  continues to provide many ancillary plumbing products  such as fittings/connections, drainage products, plumbing valves and  pumps, to its industrial, utility, institutional and municipal  customers. United's  purchasing and marketing strength has been greatly enhanced through  membership in North America's largest buying and marketing groupAffiliated Distributors (A-D). A-D is a $34-billion organization, comprised of our industry's top  independent distributors and suppliers, and is committed to enhancing  profitability and increasing market share for its members. Employing a  responsive, flexible, highly experienced and well-trained sales force,  an unmatched product range and state of the art technology, United is  poised to move into the future. ",5577

948,5,"Shultz Steel Remelting With in house re-melting, Shultz Steel is positioned to control raw materials and deliveries. Shultz Steel Company's raw materials are primarily vacuum arc remelted steels, titanium alloys and nickel base alloys. Conventionally melted and cast aluminum ingot is also used. In 1996, Shultz Steel installed its own Vacuum Arc Remelting (VAR) facility for the remelting of steel and nickel alloy ingots. This new facility requires the procurement of cast electrodes melted in an electric arc furnace or vacuum induction furnace. Subsequent VAR melting at Shultz Steel converts these electrodes into Aerospace quality ingots. Ingots are cylindrical in nature (from 20 to 40 inches diameter), weighing from 10,000 lbs.(titanium and aluminum) up to 40,000 lbs. (steel). These ingots are initially heated and open die forged in three or four operations to a billet product. This billet product is subsequently examined and inspected to verify its eternal and internal quality. The billet material is subsequently saw cut into specific weights (""Mults"") for the manufacture of open or closed die forgings. This process consists of heating the material two to six times and progressively changing its shape by forging until it finally is molded to the contour required by the drawing.

959,2,"die casting Die castingsare formed byinjecting molten metalunder high pressure into steel molds called “dies”. This process can provide a wide range of products because close tolerances can be consistently held and metal parts cab be produced efficiently and at high rates of production. Thedie casting processproduces parts that arecost-efficient and highly engineered.  The size of die castings can be as small as a matchstick and as large as 300 cubic inches. Tolerances in die casting can be held on the order of .003″ to .005″.Die castings are used in a wide variety of industries, including Agriculture, Mining, Construction Equipment, Commercial Machinery and Tools, Communications, Office Equipment, Military, Aerospace, Railroad, Automotive, Lighting and Medical. Process A steel die is mounted to a die cast machine. The mating die halves are tightly locked together to withstand the high injection pressure of the motlen metal. The molten metal is then injected into the die, the metal solidifies quickly and the part is ejected from the machine. Gates and flash are removed, and other secondary operations are performed as required. The process is repeated in rapid succession thus producing high quantities of accurate parts in a short period of time Advantages Thedie casting processoffers the following advantages: Contact Us For More Information American Aluminum Casting Company 324 Coit StreetIrvington, NJ 07111 P: 973.372.3200F: 973.375.4958E:info@aacco.net Approved Supplier  Preferred Supplier  ISO 9001-2015 ",1531
959,3,"Permanent Mold Casting Gravity pouring of molten metal into metal mold producespermanent mold castings. The molds aremade from steel or ironand have a casting production life of 10,000 – 120,000 molds depending on the part. When cores are required expendable chemically bonded sand cores are used. This is calledsemi-permanent mold casting. The size ofpermanent mold castingscan range from 1 oz. to 25 lbs.  Parts such as studs, nuts, and bushings can be incorporated as composite integral parts of the permanent mold casting. These inserts can be made from aluminum, brass, steel, stainless steel, bronze and iron, and other materials. Process Amold coatingis sprayed onto the surface of the preheated steel or iron mold.  If a core is used then it is inserted into the mold and the two halves are closed together. Molten metal is then poured through an opening called a sprue. The metal solidifies, the mold is opened and the casting is removed. Advantages Thepermanent mold processoffers the following advantages: Permanent mold castingshave a finer grain structure and increased strength properties over other processes. Part designs can include thinner walls, lower weights and closer dimensional tolerances. Permanent moldsdo not contain the products of combustion found insand molds. Therefore, apermanent mold castingcan be held to higher standards with regard to density and pressure tightness.

Spartan Light Metal Products’ Hannibal, Missouri plant has been recognized for quality and delivery by Toyota for seven consecutive years.

Currently celebrating 21 years, ABM allows TMNA to discuss business objectives with direct and indirect suppliers in preparation for its upcoming fiscal year. Each year, TMNA recognizes suppliers who exceeded the company’s expectations in several categories. “Toyota collaborates with each of our supplier partners in order to build vehicles with the high safety, quality and reliability standards to meet and exceed our customer’s expectation,” said Robert Young, Group Vice President, TMNA R&D Purchasing and Supplier Engineering Development. “We are pleased to recognize those in our supply base who exceed our high performance targets. We thank them and their team members for their tremendous support, partnership and commitment to continuous improvement and collaboration to build ‘ever better cars’ in North America.” Toyota (NYSE:TM), creator of the Prius and the Mirai fuel cell vehicle, is committed to advancing mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands.

They believed that they could vastly improve the quality, price and service that was offered at the time by the aluminum die casting industry. The Wolny family grew the business by accepting the challenging projects that other die-casters didn’t want. The willingness to go above and beyond for customers and help solve complex problems has been a foundational pillar which has allowed Dart Casting to grow from that one die casting machine to 17 today.

Serving multiple markets including Aerospace, Military, Defense, Automobile, Semiconductor, Nuclear and Space Manufacturing. Our experience team of metallurgists and technicians delivers quality and consistency to your forging requirements. ​ Technology Of all structural metals and alloys, the aluminum alloys are the most readily forged to precise intricate shapes.  Hydraulic presses often are preferred for aluminum because they are most versatile and slow forging speeds are of little concern, compared to what would be true for steel forgings.  Hand forgings are commonly produced in simple shapes such as squares, rectangles, biscuits and multi-faced rounds.  Pre-formed Shapes and Special Shapes Superior can also forge pre-formed shapes and special shapes depending on your order.  Standard-shape hand forgings can be described without the aid of a drawing. A critical factor in designing small forgings is the grain-flow patterns.  The predominant direction of grain flow is normally longitudinal in squares, rectangles, and multi-faced rounds. In biscuits, the predominant grain flow is usually radial. ©2023 Superior Handforge Albert Industries Ltd.

1142,1,"Magnetic Materials Rare Earth Magnets  High Performance Magnets Alnico Magnets - High Performance The most common magnetic materials in use today are alnico, ceramic (hard ferrites), samarium cobalt, and neodymium.  Each are made up of different elements used for different applications. Short Timeline of Modern Permanent Magnets A big step in the evolution of the permanent magnet materials used today came in the 1930’s with the development of Alnico magnets. In 1931, T. Mishima discovered that an alloy of iron, nickel, aluminum had a much higher coercivity than the best steel magnets of the time. Further research created alnico, a term referring to a series of permanent magnet alloys which in addition to iron are composed primarily of aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co). Various alnico grades with differing magnetic properties can be achieved by modifying the chemistry and manufacturing process. Today’s composition of alnico alloys is typically 8–12% Al, 15–26% Ni, 5–24% Co, up to 6% Cu, up to 1% Ti, with the balance being Fe. In addition to varying the alloy composition, specialized casting techniques can be used to achieve unique crystalline grain orientation. Examples of this are alnico 5-7 and 9. Once magnetized, Alnico magnets have between 5 and 17 times the magnetic force of magnetite or lodestone, a naturally occurring magnet which can attract iron. Alnico magnets have the benefit of having the lowest temperature coefficient, or temperature stability of all of the permanent magnet materials. Plus, they can be calibrated and have high residual induction.Before the development of rare earth magnets in the 1970’s, alnico was the strongest type of permanent magnet. Since that time, many applications using alnico have replaced it with less expensive or more powerful types of magnets. However, the fact that alnico can be used in very high temperatures (up to 930°F or 500°C) make them indispensable in certain applications. Alnico magnets are also ideal for corrosive applications and are commonly used for various types of sensors. They are stronger than ceramic magnets, but not as strong as rare-earth magnets. Manufacturing Processes: Alnico magnets are manufactured either by casting or sintering: Most alnico produced is anisotropic, meaning that the magnetic direction of the grains is oriented in one direction.  This orientation is achieved via heat treatment after casting or sintering.  The process involves heating the cast or sintered part above its Curie temperature and then cooling it at a controlled rate in the presence of a strong directional magnetic field.  Final shaping of the alnico materials is achieved by abrasive grinding and cutting where close tolerances are required. Properties: Hard Ferrites Ceramic magnets, like the ones used in refrigerator magnets and elementary-school science experiments, contain iron oxide in a ceramic composite.  Most ceramic magnets, sometimes known as ferrite magnets, aren’t particularly strong. Ceramic permanent magnets are made from finely powdered barium ferrite or strontium ferrite formed under heat and pressure.  Their magnetic strength is enhanced by aligning the powder particles with a strong magnetic field during forming.  Ceramic magnets are somewhat comparable to alnico magnets in terms of magnetic force and have the advantage of being able to be pressed into various shapes without significant machining.  However, hard ferrites are not magnetically stable at higher temperatures.  They are typically used in magnets where price is a primary driver, rather than size or mass. Advantages: Disadvantages: Samarium Cobalt Magnets In the 1970s, researchers developed permanent magnets made from powdered samarium cobalt fused under heat.  Samarium cobalt magnets can be made to produce magnetic fields 50 times stronger than magnetite.  Samarium cobalt magnets can operate in higher temperatures, but cannot be calibrated. Samarium cobalt magnets are made mostly from samarium and cobalt, with small amounts of other elements such as iron, copper, zirconium and hafnium.  The majority of the material is cobalt.  They are typically used in higher temperature applications where the strength of rare earth magnets is still needed.  They have a higher Curie temperature than NdFeB, but are also more expensive to manufacture. Neodymium Iron Boron Magnets The newest permanent magnet material was developed in the 1980s using powdered neodymium iron boron (NdFeB).  This type of magnetic material produces magnetic forces almost 75 times stronger than magnetite.  These are the most powerful permanent magnets commercially available today. Neodymium magnets are made up of neodymium, iron and boron, with the majority being iron.  They are the strongest type of permanent magnet available.  While they have the highest magnetic field strength, they have a lower Curie temperature and are more vulnerable to oxidation than samarium cobalt magnets.  Corrosion causes the material to crumble into a powder, losing their magnetic properties. Bonded or Flexible Permanent Magnets Bonded or flexible permanent magnets are made from mixing magnetic materials with a rubber or plastic matrix.  Nearly any magnet material can be used to create a bonded magnet.  The most common bonded materials incorporate either hard ferrites or NdFeB.  For instance, powdered barium ferrite or strontium ferrite can be mixed in a binding material such as rubber or a flexible plastic like polyvinyl chloride, to form a bonded magnet material.  The magnetic performance of the bonded magnet can be impacted by the concentration level of magnet material to binder. Alnico magnets have the benefit of having the lowest temperature coefficient, or temperature stability, of all of the permanent magnet materials.

1181,14,"What Are Lifting Magnets Made Of? What kinds of materials are used in making magnets? How do we select the magnets that power lifting magnets such as our Magnetic SpecialtiesModel 1037? It takes a lot more power to lift 2,500 pounds of steel plate than can be found in a steel or iron compass needle, that’s for sure. Magnetic materials used these days fall into four groups: Alnico, Ceramic (Ferrite), Samarium-Cobalt, and Neodymium. Each has its own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. Alnicomagnets are made from iron alloyed primarily with aluminum, nickel, and cobalt, thus the name, though they can also include copper or titanium, and these magnets have been around since the 1930s.While not the strongest magnets when compared to rare earth magnets, they have the highest range of operating temperatures. As temperature increases, magnets begin to lose strength, and when the temperature reaches theCurie temperaturefor that magnetic material, they lose all magnetization and become useless as magnets until remagnetized. The Curie temperatures for Alnico magnets are the highest, in the range of 800° C and with a maximum normal operating temperature in the range of 500° C. Depending on the exact Alnico alloy, Alnico magnets can be isotropic, able to be magnetized in any direction, while others are anositropic, having a preferred direction of magnetization. They are less resistant to corrosion than the rare earth magnets, but not so much as the ferrites. Though the oldest of the four categories of magnets listed above, their combination of strength and thermal characteristics makes them still relevant today, and they are used in such areas as the manufacture of guitar pickups, electric motors, microphones, sensors, and loudspeakers. Ceramicmagnets (Ferritemagnets) were also originally developed in the 1930s, with technological advances increasing their magnetic strength to the levels we see today. They are made from iron (III) oxide mixed with other elements such as strontium, barium, manganese, nickel, or zinc, and are strong, very resistant to corrosion, retain their magnetism very well, and economical of cost. This combination of factors makes ceramic magnets the magnet of choice for applications such ourModel 1057lifting magnet, able to lift up to 2500 pounds of steel plate, as well as for magnetic sign capping with ourMagna Caps. Unusually compared to other ferromagnetic materials, ferrite magnets are not conductors of electricity. They have a good operating temperature range, though with a Curie temperature in the range of 450° C not to the level of Alnico magnets. Due to the combination of cost and power, ceramic magnets see wide applications industrially in lifting and separating, and because of their lack of electrical conductivity, find use in transformers and even electromagnets to control eddy current losses. The core memory of early computers was made with ferrite cores, and ferrite particles and powder are even used in magnetic recording tape as well as in radar-absorbing stealth technology. Neodymiummagnets are the magnets people usually mean when they speak of rare earth magnets, though there are actually 17 rare earth elements, and samarium-cobalt magnets are also rare earth magnets. They have the highest strength for their size, of all the types of magnets you can buy today, which makes them the choice when power is the only consideration, but they have significant disadvantages as well. They were discovered in the 1980s independently by General Motors and by Sumitomo Special Metals and are available in several grades of strength, from N28 to N52 (the strongest). All are anisotropic, strongly having a preferred direction of magnetization and difficult to magnetize in other directions. They tend to be vulnerable to corrosion and are thus often covered with a protective coat. Neodymium magnets are very costly, and not generally suitable for high-temperature applications due to their lowish Curie temperatures, in the 300-400° C range. Even with these disadvantages however they find wide usage, in applications from electric motors and computer hard drives to magnetic bearings and loudspeakers. Samarium-Cobaltmagnets are our final class of magnets, and they, like neodymium magnets, belong to the category of rare earth magnets. Like neodymium magnets they are quite strong, though not quite so much so as the neodymium. When you add in the fact that they are also brittle, like neodymium magnets, but are even more costly, you might think that there is no reason for using them, but they do have one large advantage over neodymium, and that is the operating range of temperatures, with Curie temperatures in the range of 700-800° C, about twice as high as for neodymium. AtMagnetic Specialties, we have dealt with all of these from the ceramic magnets utilized in ourModel 1037, 1037jr,and otherlifting magnets, to custom-designed neodymium applications.

1191,1,"Open The Door Products About us The Founder ofOpen The Door Productshas over 50 years of experience in the custom cabinetry industry. We sincerely believe that life is about relationships; the better our relationships, the better our lives. It is our goal to create relationships of the highest integrity with our suppliers, employees, distributors, cabinet shops, and the end users.  Our Purpose Our purpose is to fulfill a 40 plus year need for a better magnetic catch. Most magnetic catches are noisy, hard to open, and cheap-looking on high-quality cabinetry. All other types of latches such as ball catches, roller catches and turn latches require that you push and follow the door until it is completely closed. Spring-loaded hinges were developed to solve this problem, but they fall short of filling all the requirements of inset cabinetry because an adjustable door stop is still needed.  Many “purist” designers prefer the appearance of an exposed “butt-type” hinge, which opens 180 degrees rather than the 110/120 degrees of a concealed euro hinge. Another need in the high-end custom cabinet industry is a way of preventing warped doors. Our catch employs two high-strength, high-grade permanent neodymium magnets with enough force to pull in mildly warped doors. It also stands to reason that if a magnet can pull in warped doors, the constant force will help to prevent most doors from warping in the future. We have even seen our magnets pull in non-warped doors to compensate for improperly installed cabinets that are ""racked"". How valuable is the warped door prevention to you? Consider how much it costs to replace a door. How nearly impossible it is to produce a new door that matches well because it is probably not made from the same batch of wood, possibly made and finished by different people, and will not have the same amount of aging. This benefit alone could nearly offset the difference in the cost of the soft close magnetic catches and you also have the advantage of quiet, soft-closing and easy to open action, which is a great sales advantage for your product.

1191,3,"Open The Door Products FAQ's At Open the Door Products, we've done our best to create a Website that anticipates and satisfies our customers' needs. With that goal in mind, we've compiled a list of frequently asked questions. If you do not find an answer to your question here, contact us at 518.568.2969 oropenthedoor@frontier.com Where can we buy the products? SeeContactus What wood species are available? Inventoried wood species are maple, cherry, walnut, red oak, white oak, and mahogany. other species are available by special order. Why do you use wooden mounting bases? Die cast metal and plastic-mounting bases are available on the market, however they are too low-profile to work properly on inset cabinetry. The corresponding door magnet is too close to the edge of the door. Another reason is that they do not provide the adjustability that is needed with most cabinetry. A third reason is that a mounting base made of wood that matches the cabinet interior will visually blend in and be less noticeable. These units are designed first for great function and then to blend in with the cabinet interior. What makes these closers so quiet? We use two precisely tuned magnets to draw the door closed in combination with a shock absorber to keep the door from slamming or bouncing open. Additionally, we do not allow the magnets to make contact by separating them with a soft, pyramid-shaped neoprene bumper. What type of magnets are used? The Neodymium, rare earth, magnets are made to our specific ""tuned"" size, strength and grade. They are permanent magnets tested to lose less than 5% of their strength of 10 years. How can your magnets be strong enough to pull in warped doors and still be easy to open? Most magnets are rated by theirholdingforce. To create ease of opening, we do not allow the two magnets to make contact by applying a pyramid-shaped, soft neoprene bumper between them. This also makes them very quiet, but creates the need for fine tuning the strength and grade of the magnets to off-set the resistance of the shock absorber. Can the wood mounting bases be finished to match cabinet interiors? Yes, you can paint over the existing natural finish (after removing the shock), or by ordering unfinished units in maple, cherry, walnut, red oak, white oak, and mahogany. Other wood species are available by special order with longer lead times and a minimum order. Do mounting bases have to be disassembled to finish? Only the shock must be removed because application of finish will likely inhibit it's function. It is important that you do not apply an excessive amount of finish to the inside of the bore for the shock because it may cause the block to split when reinserting the shock. you can paint or varnish over the magnet without affecting it's function. What keeps the magnets in the mounting base and the cabinet door? We use a pin that is pressed through the wood and a hole in the magnet to keep the magnet in the block. Using the pin for mounting makes it possible to reverse the magnet polarity, if necessary. The corresponding door magnet fits tightly into a properly drilled hole, however we know that wood will dry out and this magnet could come loose. To prevent this possibility we use a screw mount door magnet. Refer to theProductssection for a picture. What type of shock absorber do you use and why? We use an Italian-made shock by Salice because they are available in different strengths and the one that we use works best at dampening the drawing force of the magnets and preventing bounce if the door is slammed. Other shocks on the market are self-adjusting, which does not work as well for our particular purpose. How difficult are your catches to install? There is very little difference from installing a standard magnet with a metal plate. there are two screws in the mounting base and one hole to drill in the cabinet door for the magnet to be glued in, The final step is application of the soft, pyramid-shaped bumper, which is self-adhesive. We recommend a placement jig and C-clamp for consistent mounting of the blocks in the cabinet and a drill press with a jig for consistent drilling of door magnet holes for high production efficiency. What happens if my cabinet floor is not flush with the inside edge of my face frame? There will be no problem if the floor is very, nearly flush (i.e.: within 1/32"" to 1/16"") with the inside of the face frame. The problem that can occur is the magnet in the door will become very close to the edge of the door. This may create the need to shim the mounting base or request a higher mounting base made for your situation. What height blocks are kept in stock for quick delivery? The soft-close mounting blocks standard height is 3/4"". These are available in all of our normal wood species. We now stock 7/8"" high blocks in maple, cherry, and walnut. These are used when cabinets are constructed with floors held down from the edge of the face frame so that the floor can be machined into the face frame. Refer to theProductspage to see these blocks. Can we get custom-sized mounting blocks? Yes, in situations such as floors that are not flush with the top edge of the face frame you may need a higher block. These can be produced, but with longer lead times and minimum order quantities. What color door shocks are available? Honey-colored shocks are standard. White shocks are available, if requested only, when ordering unfinished maple blocks. The white shocks are ideal when cabinets are being painted to match light-colored painted interiors. How long does it take for delivery? We maintain a considerable inventory of all items shown in the ""Products"" section. Thus, we will normally ship via FedEx within one day of your order. Large or custom orders may take four to five weeks to produce, so we recommend that you order units when your project is sold rather than wait until the day you need them.

Windows function in different ways – some slide, some tilt, some fold back on themselves. By understanding the different types available and how they work, you can better match windows to your needs, and your lifestyle. Take a look through our windows  Awning and Casement Windows Awning and casement windows can add an elegant, traditional look to your home or apartment. It’s simple to tell the difference – awnings are hung from the top, while casements open from a vertical edge. Both options are practical, easy to use and provide excellent ventilation. Awnings can also be left partly open when it’s raining – so they’re great in winter too. Sliding Windows When space is at a premium, or it’s not possible to have a protruding window beyond the building,sliding windowsmay be the best option. Available as either vertical (double hung) or horizontal, sliding windows create a feeling of space and light. And because they often provide more access to open air than other conventional windows, they also provide increased ventilation. Bi-fold Windows Flexible, unobtrusive, and robust,bi-fold windows seamlessly connect the areas in your home, creating a sense of space, light and openness. Whether it’s between two separate rooms, or your indoor and outdoor spaces, a well-placed bi-fold window maximises your available view and increases airflow. In fact, when fully opened, you won’t even notice the window is there at all. It’s a simple way to bring a café-like feel to your living areas. Louvre Windows Mixing style and practicality,louvres offer the ultimate in ventilation control. Open them up fully to make the most of a cool summer breeze with an almost unobstructed view, or partially (even during wet weather) to maintain ventilation and help prevent condensation. Best of all, you can clean both sides of a louvre window from inside – especially useful if you live in a multi-story apartment. Replacement Windows & Doors Many people don’t consider the window and doors in their home until they’re undertaking a major renovation or a new build. The truth is, by replacing frames in your home now, you could make a real and lasting difference to your property’s value, as well as its liveability. Aluminium joinery makes an immediate impact on your home’s street appeal (and puts an end to the peeling paint on your windows). And when you incorporate features like double glazing or thermally broken joinery, you can make your home more enjoyable to live in, and lower your energy bills too. It’s not just a more comfortable way to live; it’s a smart investment too. Downloads WindowsDoors Your new view awaits Contact us today for a free measure and quote.

This coating lets the sun’s light and energy into your home and reflect heat back indoors, forming a shield against the cold. In warmer climates low-e glass can be used to keep the heat out. U-value The measure of air-to-air heat transfer through glass and the difference between the indoor and outdoor temperatures. The lower the U-value, the lower the heat transfer and the better the insulation. R-value The thermal resistance of the total window system (including glass, spacer and joinery type). The higher the R-value, the less heat that is lost through the system and the better the insulation. Shading co-efficient The ratio of total solar heat gain through a particular glass type compared to the total heat gain through 3mm clear glass. The lower the shading co-efficient, he more the glass restricts the transfer of solar heat. Visible light transmission The percentage of visible light transmitted through the glass.

1216,1,"Anodes  A galvanic anode is the main component of a galvanic Cathodic Protection (CP) system used to protect buried or submerged metal structures from corrosion. They are made from a metal alloy with a more ""active"" voltage (more negative electrochemical potential) than the metal of the structure. The difference in potential between the two metals means that the galvanic an ode corrodes, so that the anode material is consumed in preference to the structure. The loss (or sacrifice) of the anode material gives rise to the alternative name of sacrificial anode. Anode Materials There are three main alloys used as galvanic anodes, magnesium, aluminum and zinc. They are all available as blocks, rods, plates or extruded ribbon. Each material has advantages and disadvantages. Aluminum Aluminum anodes have several advantages: they are much lighter in weight, and have a much higher capacity than zinc. Their electrochemical behavior is not considered as reliable as zinc and greater care must be taken in how they are used. When aluminum strikes a rusty surface a large thermite spark may be generated, so its use is restricted in tanks where there may be explosive atmospheres and there is a risk of the anode falling. Read more about ourAluminum Anodes... Zinc Zinc is considered a reliable material but is not suitable for use at higher temperatures as it tends to passivate (it becomes less negative - if this happens, current may cease to flow and the anode stops working).It has a relatively low driving voltage, which means in higher resistivity soils or water it may not be able to provide sufficient current. However, in some circumstances, where there is a risk of hydrogen embrittlement for example, the low driving voltage is an advantage since overprotection is avoided. Read more about ourZinc Anodes... Magnesium Magnesium has the most negative electropotential of the three (see Galvanic series) and is more suitable for areas where the electrolyte (soil or water) resistivity is higher. This is usually on-shore pipelines and other buried structures, although it is also used on boats in fresh water and in water heaters. In some cases, the negative potential of magnesium can be a disadvantage. If the potential of the protected metal becomes too negative, hydrogen ions may be evolved on the cathode surface leading to hydrogen embrittlement or to disbonding of the coating , Where this is a possibility, zinc anodes may be used.  Read more about ourMagnesium Anodes... Zinc and aluminum are generally used in salt water, where the resistivity is generally lower. Typical uses are for the hulls of ships and boats, offshore pipelines and production platforms, in salt-water cooled marine engines, on small boat propellers and rudders and for the internal surface of storage tanks. Since the operation of a galvanic anode relies on the difference in electropotential between the anode and the cathode, practically any metal can be used to protect any other, providing there is a sufficient difference in potential. For example, iron anodes can be used to protect copper.

1222,1,"HOME ABOUT PENTACAST SERVICES CONTACT More SERVICES Quality die casting ​ The Die Cast process allows products to be made with a high degree of accuracy and repeatability. The die casting process also produces fine details such as textured surfaces without requiring further processing.  Unlike other manufacturing processes such as extrusion, the die casting process does not limit the shape of parts.  Die cast parts are able to withstand to a broader range of temperature, making it more ideal in harsh temperatures and working environments. ​ Since PentaCast can produce complexe parts to near net shape, there is little or no machining process required thus reducing the production time. ​ PentaCast uses both hot and cold chamber processes.  The hot chamber process has a short cycle time as it does not require metal to be transported from a separate furnace.  Cold Chamber Die Casting is used primarily for aluminum alloys. Permanent mold - gravity die casting machines ​ The Permanent mold process produces non-ferrous high density, high strength castings with a smooth surface finish compared to sand-casting. Good part repeatability, and the rapid solidification of metal creates fine grain structure with superior metallurgical properties. ​ Tilt pouring reduces turbulence as molten metal enters the die cavity, provides shorter cycle times, and requires less metal for feeding systems. Aluminum castings produced in metal molds have a tighter dendrite structure than castings produced in other processes. In addition, aluminum castings are harder and have better pressure characteristics. Value added options, such as sand cores or cast-in ferrous inserts are quite simple. Prototyping and low to high volume production processes ​ PentaCast specializes in the production of aluminum and zinc parts in prototype and low-high volume production quantities through our diverse processes.  Our operations are designed to deliver individual parts and complete assemblies very quickly. ​ Our proprietary casting processes shortens the time from conception to finished product. ​ Green Manufacturing:  According to scientists, plastics takes at least a few hundreds of years to degrade fully.  This means that obsolete plastic products are pilled up in the landfills, polluting and causing health hazards.  Unlike plastic, die casting parts are primarily made of recycled material.  On average, approximately 95% of the metal is recycled from salvaged parts making it a sustainable material that can be used over and over again without degradation. Engineering ​ At PentaCast we are continuously striving to improve our products through innovation and creative thinking.  We work closely with our clients and supplier partners to provide cost effective performance. ​ We have solid Strategic partnerships with market leader vendors & suppliers.
